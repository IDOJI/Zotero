abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be a stage of pre-dementia. There is no consensus about pharmacological treatment for this population, so it is important to structure non-pharmacological interventions for increasing their cognitive reserve. We intended to analyze the effects of non-pharmacological interventions in the cognitive functions in older people with MC, in form of a systemic review. Data sources were the Web of Science, Biological Abstracts, Medline, Pub Med, EBSCHost, Scirus and Google Scholar. All studies were longitudinal trials, with MCI sample, aged {\textgreater} 60 years, community-dwelling, and having cognitive functions as dependent variable. Seven studies, from 91 previously selected ones, were identified according to the inclusion criteria. Six studies used cognitive intervention, improving memory and one study used physical activity as intervention, improving executive functions. The results show evidence that physical activity and cognitive exercise may improve memory and executive functions in older people with MCI. But yet, more controlled studies are needed to establish a protocol of recommendations regarding the systemization of exercise, necessary to produce benefits in the cognitive functioning in older people with MCI. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Papaverine, 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline, a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A with IC50 values of 36 nM for PDE10A, 1,300 nM for PDE3A and 320 nM for PDE4D, has served as a useful pharmaceutical tool to study the physiological role of PDE10A. Here, we report the radiosynthesis of [11C]papaverine and the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of [11C]papaverine as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging PDE10A in the central nervous system (CNS). The radiosynthesis of papaverine with 11C was achieved by O-methylation of the corresponding des-methyl precursor with [11C]methyl iodide. [11C]papaverine was obtained with {\~{}}70{\%} radiochemical yield and a specific activity {\textgreater}10 Ci/Μmol. In vitro autoradiography studies of rat and monkey brain sections revealed selective binding of [11C]papaverine to PDE10A enriched regions: the striatum of rat brain and the caudate and putamen of rhesus monkey brain. The biodistribution of [11C]papaverine in rats at 5 min demonstrated an initially higher accumulation in striatum than in other brain regions, however the washout was rapid. MicroPET imaging studies in rhesus macaques similarly displayed initial specific uptake in the striatum with very rapid clearance of [11C]papaverine from brain. Our initial evaluation suggests that despite papaverine's utility for in vitro studies and as a pharmaceutical tool, [11C]papaverine is not an ideal radioligand for clinical imaging of PDE10A in the CNS. Analogs of papaverine having a higher potency for inhibiting PDE10A and improved pharmacokinetic properties will be necessary for imaging this enzyme with PET. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is very common in elderly and related to cognition, although this relation is weak. This might be because the underlying pathology of white matter lesions (WML) is diverse and cannot be properly appreciated with conventional FLAIR MRI. In addition, conventional MRI is not sensitive to early loss of microstructural integrity of the normal appearing white matter (NAWM), which might be an important factor. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides alternative information on microstructural white matter integrity and we have used this to investigate the relation between white matter integrity, in both WML and NAWM, and cognition among elderly with cerebral SVD. Methods: The RUN DMC study is a prospective cohort study among 503 independently living, non-demented elderly with cerebral SVD aged between 50 and 85. years. All subjects underwent MRI and DTI scanning. WML were segmented manually. We measured mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), as assessed by DTI in both WML and NAWM. Results: Inverse relations were found between MD in the WML and NAWM and global cognitive function ($\beta$. = -.11, p. {\textless}. 0.05; $\beta$. = -.18, p. {\textless}. 0.001), psychomotor speed ($\beta$. = -.15, p. {\textless}. 0.01; $\beta$. = -.18, p. {\textless}. 0.001), concept shifting ($\beta$. = -.11, p. {\textless}. 0.05; $\beta$. = -.10, p. {\textless}. 0.05) and attention ($\beta$. = -.12, p. {\textless}. 0.05; $\beta$. = -.15, p. {\textless}. 0.001). The relation between DTI parameters in both WML and NAWM and cognitive performance was most pronounced in subjects with severe WML. Conclusion: DTI parameters in both WML and NAWM correlate with cognitive performance, independent of SVD. DTI may be a promising tool in exploring the mechanisms of cognitive decline and could function as a surrogate marker for disease progression in therapeutic trials.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06-0.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.

abstract = {This study evaluates the individual, as well as relative and joint value of indices obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of brain atrophy (quantified by the SPARE-AD index), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, APOE genotype, and cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog) in progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a variable follow-up period up to 6 years, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1). SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE $\epsilon$4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of A$\beta$1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding a suitable common low dimensional subspace for accurately representing a given set of covariance matrices. With one covariance matrix, this is principal component analysis (PCA). For multiple covariance matrices, we term the problem Common Component Analysis (CCA).While CCA can be posed as a tensor decomposition problem, standard approaches to tensor decompositions have two critical issues: (i) tensor decomposition methods are iterative and rely on the initialization; (ii) for a given level of approximation error, it is difficult to choose a suitable low dimensionality. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of CCA that yields an effective initialization and iterative algorithms for the problem. The proposed methodology has provable approximation guarantees w.r.t. the global maximum and also allows one to choose the dimensionality for a given level of approximation error. We also establish conditions under which the methodology will achieve the global maximum. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments on synthetic data as well as on two real stock market datasets, where major financial events can be visualized in low dimensions.

abstract = {Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture. Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls. Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity. Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.},

abstract = {Objectives: To provide updated estimates of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia prevalence in the United States from 2010 through 2050. Methods: Probabilities of AD dementia incidence were calculated from a longitudinal, populationbased study including substantial numbers of both black and white participants. Incidence probabilities for single year of age, race, and level of education were calculated using weighted logistic regression and AD dementia diagnosis from 2,577 detailed clinical evaluations of 1,913 people obtained from stratified random samples of previously disease-free individuals in a population of 10,800. These were combined with US mortality, education, and new US Census Bureau estimates of current and future population to estimate current and future numbers of people with AD dementia in the United States. Results: We estimated that in 2010, there were 4.7 million individuals aged 65 years or older with AD dementia (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 4.0-5.5). Of these, 0.7 million (95{\%}CI = 0.4-0.9) were between 65 and 74 years, 2.3 million were between 75 and 84 years (95{\%}CI = 1.7-2.9), and 1.8 million were 85 years or older (95{\%} CI = 1.4-2.2). The total number of people with AD dementia in 2050 is projected to be 13.8 million, with 7.0 million aged 85 years or older. Conclusion: The number of people in the United States with AD dementia will increase dramatically in the next 40 years unless preventive measures are developed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {In conventional resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) analysis, functional connectivity is assumed to be temporally stationary, overlooking neural activities or interactions that may happen within the scan duration. Dynamic changes of neural interactions can be reflected by variations of topology and correlation strength in temporally correlated functional connectivity networks. These connectivity networks may potentially capture subtle yet short neural connectivity disruptions induced by disease pathologies. Accordingly, we are motivated to utilize disrupted temporal network properties for improving control-patient classification performance. Specifically, a sliding window approach is firstly employed to generate a sequence of overlapping R-fMRI sub-series. Based on these sub-series, sliding window correlations, which characterize the neural interactions between brain regions, are then computed to construct a series of temporal networks. Individual estimation of these temporal networks using conventional network construction approaches fails to take into consideration intrinsic temporal smoothness among successive overlapping R-fMRI sub-series. To preserve temporal smoothness of R-fMRI sub-series, we suggest to jointly estimate the temporal networks by maximizing a penalized log likelihood using a fused sparse learning algorithm. This sparse learning algorithm encourages temporally correlated networks to have similar network topology and correlation strengths. We design a disease identification framework based on the estimated temporal networks, and group level network property differences and classification results demonstrate the importance of including temporally dynamic R-fMRI scan information to improve diagnosis accuracy of mild cognitive impairment patients.},

abstract = {High correlation among the neighboring pixels both spatially and spectrally in a multispectral image makes it necessary to use an efficient data transformation approach before performing pan-sharpening. Wavelets and principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been a popular choice for spatial and spectral transformations, respectively. Current PCA-based pan-sharpening methods make an assumption that the first principal component (PC) of high variance is an ideal choice for replacing or injecting it with high spatial details from the high-resolution histogram-matched panchromatic (PAN) image. This paper presents a combined adaptive PCA-contourlet approach for pan-sharpening, where the adaptive PCA is used to reduce the spectral distortion and the use of nonsubsampled contourlets for spatial transformation in pan-sharpening is incorporated to overcome the limitation of the wavelets in representing the directional information efficiently and capturing intrinsic geometrical structures of the objects. The efficiency of the presented method is tested by performing pan-sharpening of the high-resolution (IKONOS and QuickBird) and the medium-resolution (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) datasets. The evaluation of the pan-sharpened images using global validation indexes reveal that the adaptive PCA approach helps reducing the spectral distortion, and its merger with contourlets provides better fusion results. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) for oral tacrolimus (FK) may provide a more precise model for FK monitoring after renal transplantation. The purpose of this study is to identify a simple, cost- effective method for predicting FK AUC. FK concentrations were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after the morning dose. The predicted AUCs (AUC(p)s) derived from regression equations were used to estimate the actual 12-hour AUCs (AUC12s). The relationship between AUC(p) and AUC12 was validated by determining the coefficient of multiple determination (R2), percentage of prediction error (PE{\%}), and percentage of absolute prediction error (APE{\%}). Eighteen stable Oriental renal transplant recipients (9 men, 9 women) with a mean age of 42.6 ± 6 years and mean body weight of 62.7 ± 10 kg were recruited for the study. The FK AUC12, through, 2-hour, and 4-hour concentrations were 125 ± 24 h {\textperiodcentered} ng/mL (range, 87.7 to 181.9 h {\textperiodcentered} ng/mL), 6 ± 1.3 ng/mL, 18.1 ± 4.7 ng/mL, and 11 ± 2.4 ng/mL, respectively. Through FK concentration did not have a significant correlation with AUC12 (r = 0.34; P = 0.17). AUC(p) obtained by a two-time point regression equation using 2-hour (C2) and 4-hour (C4) FK concentrations: (AUC(p) = 16.2 + 2.4*C2 + 5.9*C4) obtained an R2, PE{\%}, and APE{\%} of 0.93, -0.2{\%} ± 5.2{\%} (range, -13{\%} to 9.3{\%}), and 3.6{\%} ± 3.7{\%} (range, 0.02{\%} to 13{\%}), respectively. We conclude that a two-point sampling method using C2 and C4 may be a more cost-effective FK monitoring strategy than morning FK through levels in transplant recipients.

abstract = {Objective: Because of discrepant findings regarding the accuracy of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD), further study of this construct and conversion rates is essential before use in clinical settings. We aimed to develop an operational definition of MCI consistent with criteria proposed by the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Center, and to examine its conversion rate to AD. Methods: Patients were identified from an inception cohort of patients with at least a 3-month history of memory problems, and referred to a 2-year university teaching hospital investigation by primary care physicians. We classified 161 nondemented patients at baseline using MCI criteria. Diagnostic workups were completed annually, and patients were classified as meeting criteria for AD or showing no evidence of dementia after 1 and 2 years. Results: Of 161 patients, 35{\%} met MCI criteria at baseline. Conversion rates to AD were 41{\%} after 1 year, and 64{\%} after 2 years. Logistic regression analyses to examine predictive accuracy of MCI after 1 and 2 years, with age and education as covariates, were significant (p {\textless} 0.0001). After 1 year, MCI showed an optimal sensitivity of 91{\%} and specificity of 79{\%}, and after 2 years, these values were 88 and 83{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: MCI is an accurate predictor of AD over 1 and 2 years in patients referred by their primary care physicians. Discrepancies in conversion rates may be due to the manner in which patients are recruited to studies as well as the use of different measures to operationalize the construct.

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid technique for the classification of the magnetic resonance images (MRI). The proposed hybrid technique consists of three stages, namely, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. In the first stage, we have obtained the features related to MRI images using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). In the second stage, the features of magnetic resonance images have been reduced, using principal component analysis (PCA), to the more essential features. In the classification stage, two classifiers have been developed. The first classifier based on feed forward back-propagation artificial neural network (FP-ANN) and the second classifier is based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The classifiers have been used to classify subjects as normal or abnormal MRI human images. A classification with a success of 97{\%} and 98{\%} has been obtained by FP-ANN and k-NN, respectively. This result shows that the proposed technique is robust and effective compared with other recent work. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diffusion imaging can assess the white matter connections within the brain, revealing how neural pathways break down in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed 3-Tesla whole-brain diffusion-weighted images from 202 participants scanned by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative–50 healthy controls, 110 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 42 AD patients. From whole-brain tractography, we reconstructed structural brain connectivity networks to map connections between cortical regions. We tested whether AD disrupts the “rich club” – a network property where high-degree network nodes are more interconnected than expected by chance. We calculated the rich club properties at a range of degree thresholds, as well as other network topology measures including global degree, clustering coefficient, path length, and efficiency. Network disruptions predominated in the low-degree regions of the connectome in patients, relative to controls. The other metrics also showed alterations, suggesting a distinctive pattern of disruption in AD, less pronounced in MCI, targeting global brain connectivity, and focusing on more remotely connected nodes rather than the central core of the network. AD involves severely reduced structural connectivity; our step-wise rich club coefficients analyze points to disruptions predominantly in the peripheral network components; other modalities of data are needed to know if this indicates impaired communication among non rich club regions. The highly connected core was relatively preserved, offering new evidence on the neural basis of progressive risk for cognitive decline.

abstract = {Landslides in the hilly terrain along the Kansas and Missouri rivers in northeastern Kansas have caused millions of dollars in property damage during the last decade. To address this problem, a statistical method called multiple logistic regression has been used to create a landslide-hazard map for Atchison, Kansas, and surrounding areas. Data included digitized geology, slopes, and landslides, manipulated using ArcView GIS. Logistic regression relates predictor variables to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of landslides within geographic cells and uses the relationship to produce a map showing the probability of future landslides, given local slopes and geologic units. Results indicated that slope is the most important variable for estimating landslide hazard in the study area. Geologic units consisting mostly of shale, siltstone, and sandstone were most susceptible to landslides. Soil type and aspect ratio were considered but excluded from the final analysis because these variables did not significantly add to the predictive power of the logistic regression. Soil types were highly correlated with the geologic units, and no significant relationships existed between landslides and slope aspect. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Recently, a new trend in ELM emerges to combine it with ridge regression, which has been shown improved stability and generalization performance. However, this ridge parameter is determined through a trial-and-error manner, an unsatisfactory approach for automatic learning applications. In this paper, the differences between ridge ELM and ordinary Neural Networks are discussed as well as special properties of ridge ELM and various approaches to derive the ridge parameter. Furthermore, a semi-cross-validation ridge parameter selection procedure based on the special properties of ridge ELM is proposed.

abstract = {Amyloid imaging is a valuable tool for research and diagnosis in dementing disorders. As positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have limited spatial resolution, measured signals are distorted by partial volume effects. Various techniques have been proposed for correcting partial volume effects, but there is no consensus as to whether these techniques are necessary in amyloid imaging, and, if so, how they should be implemented. We evaluated a two-component partial volume correction technique and a regional spread function technique using both simulated and human Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging data. Both correction techniques compensated for partial volume effects and yielded improved detection of subtle changes in PiB retention. However, the regional spread function technique was more accurate in application to simulated data. Because PiB retention estimates depend on the correction technique, standardization is necessary to compare results across groups. Partial volume correction has sometimes been avoided because it increases the sensitivity to inaccuracy in image registration and segmentation. However, our results indicate that appropriate PVC may enhance our ability to detect changes in amyloid deposition.},

However, definitive neuropsychological evidence supporting the superior parietal lobule's purported role in working memory has been lacking. Here, we studied human brain lesion patients to determine whether the superior parietal lobule is indeed necessary for working memory. We assessed a wide range of memory functions in three participant groups: superior parietal lesions (n = 19), lesions not involving superior parietal cortex (n = 146), and no brain lesions (n = 55). Superior parietal damage was reliably associated with deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes, nor on tests of long-term memory. These results indicate that superior parietal cortex is critically important for the manipulation of information in working memory. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: Because Alzheimer's disease (AD) tends to be underdiagnosed, we developed a brief neurocognitive screening battery to identify AD patients. The 7 Minute Screen(TM) consists of four individual tests (orientation, memory, clock drawing, verbal fluency). The screen can be rapidly administered and scored and therefore may be appropriate for use in the primary care setting. This study determined the validity and reliability of the 7 Minute Screen in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy controls. Methods: The 7 Minute Screen was administered to 60 consecutive referrals to a memory disorders clinic who were subsequently diagnosed with probable AD and to 60 community-dwelling individuals. Analysis of the combined scores on the four individual tests was used to determine the probability of dementia in each subject. We also evaluated test-retest and inter-rater reliability, as well as the time required to administer the battery. Results: When compared with the normal subjects, the patients with AD were significantly more impaired on each of the four tests included in the 7 Minute Screen. When the four tests were combined into a logistic regression model, the battery correctly diagnosed 92{\%} of the patients with AD and 96{\%} of the normal subjects. The battery performed equally well when only patients with mild and very mild AD were included. Mean time for administration and scoring was 7 minutes 42 seconds. Conclusions: The 7 Minute Screen is a reliable and valid instrument for identifying patients with AD. It appears to be a potentially useful tool for identifying patients with AD in a primary care setting.},

abstract = {Abstract Focal epilepsy is conceived of as activating local areas of the brain as well as engaging regional brain networks. Graph theory represents a powerful quantitative framework for investigation of brain networks. Here we investigate whether functional network changes are present in extratemporal focal epilepsy. Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 15 subjects with extratemporal epilepsy and 26 age and gender matched healthy controls were used for analysis. Local network properties were calculated using local efficiency, clustering coefficient and modularity metrics. Global network properties were assessed with global efficiency and betweenness centrality metrics. Cost-efficiency of the networks at both local and global levels was evaluated by estimating the physical distance between functionally connected nodes, in addition to the overall numbers of connections in the network. Clustering coefficient, local efficiency and modularity were significantly higher in individuals with focal epilepsy than healthy control subjects, while global efficiency and betweenness centrality were not significantly different between the two groups. Local network properties were also highly efficient, at low cost, in focal epilepsy subjects compared to healthy controls. Our results show that functional networks in focal epilepsy are altered in a way that the nodes of the network are more isolated. We postulate that network regularity, or segregation of the nodes of the networks, may be an adaptation that inhibits the conversion of the interictal state to seizures. It remains possible that this may be part of the epileptogenic process or an effect of medications.},

@article{Yourganov2010,
abstract = {We explore functional connectivity in nine subjects measured with 1.5T fMRI-BOLD in a longitudinal study of recovery from unilateral stroke affecting the motor area (Small et al., 2002). We found that several measures of complexity of covariance matrices show strong correlations with behavioral measures of recovery. In Schmah et al. (2010), we applied Linear and Quadratic Discriminants (LD and QD) computed on a principal components (PC) subspace to classify the fMRI volumes into "early" and "late" sessions. We demonstrated excellent classification accuracy with QD but not LD, indicating that potentially important differences in functional connectivity exist between the early and late sessions. Motivated by McIntosh et al. (2008), who showed that EEG brain-signal variability and behavioral performance both increased with age during development, we investigated complexity of the covariance matrix for this longitudinal stroke recovery data set. We used three complexity measures: the sphericity index described by Abdi (2010); "unsupervised dimensionality", which is the number of PCs that minimizes unsupervised generalization error of a covariance matrix (Hansen et al., 1999); and "QD dimensionality", which is the number of PCs that minimizes the classification accuracy of QD. Although these approaches measure different kinds of complexity, all showed strong correlations with one or more behavioral tests: nine-hole peg test, hand grip test and pinch test. We could not demonstrate that either sphericity or unsupervised dimensionality were significantly different for the "early" and "late" sessions using a paired Wilcoxon test. However, the amount of relative behavioral improvement was correlated with sphericity of the overall covariance matrix (pooled across all sessions), as well as with the divergence of the eigenspectra between the "early" and "late" covariance matrices. Complexity measures that use the number of PCs (which optimize QD classification or unsupervised generalization) were correlated with the behavioral performance of the final session, but not with the relative improvement. These are suggestive, but limited, results given the sample size, restricted behavioral measurements and older 1.5T BOLD data sets. Nevertheless, they indicate one potentially fruitful direction for future data-driven fMRI studies of stroke recovery in larger, better-characterized longitudinal stroke data sets recorded at higher field strength. Finally, we produced sensitivity maps (Kjems et al., 2002) corresponding to both linear and quadratic discriminants for the "early" vs. "late" classification. These maps measure the influence of each voxel on the class assignments for a given classifier. Differences between the scaled sensitivity maps for the linear and quadratic discriminants indicate brain regions involved in changes in functional connectivity. These regions are highly variable across subjects, but include the cerebellum and the motor area contralateral to the lesion.},

abstract = {Background: Results of previous studies have shown associations between PET imaging of amyloid plaques and amyloid-$\beta$ pathology measured at autopsy. However, these studies were small and not designed to prospectively measure sensitivity or specificity of amyloid PET imaging against a reference standard. We therefore prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET imaging with neuropathology at autopsy. Methods: This study was an extension of our previous imaging-to-autopsy study of participants recruited at 22 centres in the USA who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months at enrolment. Participants had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging with florbetapir (18F). For one of the primary analyses, the interpretation of the florbetapir scans (majority interpretation of five nuclear medicine physicians, who classified each scan as amyloid positive or amyloid negative) was compared with amyloid pathology (assessed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease standards, and classed as amyloid positive for moderate or frequent plaques or amyloid negative for no or sparse plaques); correlation of the image analysis results with amyloid burden was tested as a coprimary endpoint. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were also done in the subset of participants who had autopsy within 1 year of imaging as secondary endpoints. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01447719 (original study NCT 00857415). Findings: We included 59 participants (aged 47-103 years; cognitive status ranging from normal to advanced dementia). The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir PET imaging for detection of moderate to frequent plaques were 92{\%} (36 of 39; 95{\%} CI 78-98) and 100{\%} (20 of 20; 80-100{\%}), respectively, in people who had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging, and 96{\%} (27 of 28; 80-100{\%}) and 100{\%} (18 of 18; 78-100{\%}), respectively, for those who had autopsy within 1 year. Amyloid assessed semiquantitatively with florbetapir PET was correlated with the post-mortem amyloid burden in the participants who had an autopsy within 2 years (Spearman $\rho$=0{\textperiodcentered}76; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and within 12 months between imaging and autopsy (0{\textperiodcentered}79; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: The results of this study validate the binary visual reading method approved in the USA for clinical use with florbetapir and suggest that florbetapir could be used to distinguish individuals with no or sparse amyloid plaques from those with moderate to frequent plaques. Additional research is needed to understand the prognostic implications of moderate to frequent plaque density. Funding: Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, we consider resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from healthy subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in two conditions: eyes-open and eyes-closed. The EEGs are used to construct functional brain networks in which the nodes are EEG sensor locations and edges represent functional connectivity between them. The networks are then tested for a number of neurobiologically relevant graph theory metrics. The analyses show that the network properties are stable across all conventional frequency bands. AD brains in eyes-closed condition show significantly reduced local efficiency and modularity measures (P {\textless} 0.05; Wilcoxon's ranksum test). We then use the network metrics as features for discriminating AD from healthy controls. Three feature selection methods (Genetic Algorithms (GA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and Social Impact Theory based Optimization (SITO)) are used to select the best feature set. GA with support vector machines (as classifier) results in an accuracy of 83{\%} in eyes-close beta band. The set of optimal features include edge betweenness centrality, global efficiency, modularity and synchronizability.},

abstract = {Several supervised learning algorithms are suited to classify instances into a multiclass value space. MultiNomial Logit (MNL) is recognized as a robust classifier and is commonly applied within the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) domain. Unfortunately, to date, it is unable to handle huge feature spaces typical of CRM applications. Hence, the analyst is forced to immerse himself into feature selection. Surprisingly, in sharp contrast with binary logit, current software packages lack any feature-selection algorithm for MultiNomial Logit. Conversely, Random Forests, another algorithm learning multiclass problems, is just like MNL robust but unlike MNL it easily handles high-dimensional feature spaces. This paper investigates the potential of applying the Random Forests principles to the MNL framework. We propose the Random MultiNomial Logit (RMNL), i.e. a random forest of MNLs, and compare its predictive performance to that of (a) MNL with expert feature selection, (b) Random Forests of classification trees. We illustrate the Random MultiNomial Logit on a cross-sell CRM problem within the home-appliances industry. The results indicate a substantial increase in model accuracy of the RMNL model to that of the MNL model with expert feature selection. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cerebrovascular disease and vascular risk factors are associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the evidence for their association with other neurodegenerative disorders is limited. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and correlate them with dementia severity. Presence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors was studied in 5715 cases of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database with a single neurodegenerative disease diagnosis (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive deposits, $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, hippocampal sclerosis and prion disease) based on a neuropathological examination with or without cerebrovascular disease, defined neuropathologically. In addition, 210 'unremarkable brain' cases without cognitive impairment, and 280 cases with pure cerebrovascular disease were included for comparison. Cases with cerebrovascular disease were older than those without cerebrovascular disease in all the groups except for those with hippocampal sclerosis. After controlling for age and gender as fixed effects and centre as a random effect, we observed that $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and prion disease showed a lower prevalence of coincident cerebrovascular disease than patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this was more significant in younger subjects. When cerebrovascular disease was also present, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with $\alpha$-synucleinopathy showed relatively lower burdens of their respective lesions than those without cerebrovascular disease in the context of comparable severity of dementia at time of death. Concurrent cerebrovascular disease is a common neuropathological finding in aged subjects with dementia, is more common in Alzheimer's disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders, especially in younger subjects, and lowers the threshold for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, which suggests that these disorders should be targeted by treatments for cerebrovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author (2013).

Here, we have investigated the role of miR-155 during an autoimmune inflammatory disease. Consistent with a positive role for miR-155 in mediating inflammatory responses, Mir155-/- mice were highly resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). miR-155 functions in the hematopoietic compartment to promote the development of inflammatory T cells including the T helper 17 (Th17) cell and Th1 cell subsets. Furthermore, the major contribution of miR-155 to EAE was CD4+ T cell intrinsic, whereas miR-155 was also required for optimum dendritic cell production of cytokines that promoted Th17 cell formation. Our study shows that one aspect of miR-155 function is the promotion of T cell-dependent tissue inflammation, suggesting that miR-155 might be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) draws attention to cognitive changes not severe enough to warrant the diagnosis of dementia. As used today, it covers many pathological disorders and characterises a diverse population of patients who attend memory clinics. Our concern is the underlying heterogeneity. We suggest that it will soon be possible (if it is not already) to identify the underlying pathological disorders before the affected patients meet the criteria of dementia, thanks to specific neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging, and biomarkers. In particular, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most important subgroup of patients with MCI, can already be identified before appearance of the fully developed clinical dementia syndrome. Accordingly, this paper proposes diagnostic criteria for "prodromal AD".},

abstract = {Background: Increasing evidence suggests vascular risk factors (VRF) play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have found associations between VRF and risk of AD. Treating VRF in patients with AD offers a potential treatment option but ineffective treatments should be avoided in this group who are frequently on multiple medications and in whom compliance may be challenging. Methods: Studies containing information on the treatment of VRF in patients with a diagnosis of AD were identified using a defined search strategy. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were included. Results: The pre-specified search strategy retrieved 11,992 abstract articles, and 25 papers including those identified on review of reference lists and reviews met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. Observational studies suggested that a VRF package and treatment of hypertension and statin therapy may be associated with improved outcome but these studies suffered from potential bias. The few RCTs performed were mostly small with short duration follow-up, and do not provide clear evidence either way. Conclusions: Observational data raises the possibility that treating VRF could alter the rate of decline in AD. However RCT data are not yet available to support this hypothesis and to alter clinical practice. RCTs in larger numbers of individuals with longer follow-up, ideally in the early stages of AD, are required to address this potentially important treatment question.},

@article{Christian2009,
abstract = {Purpose: Biological image-guided radiotherapy aims at specifically irradiating biologically relevant sub-volumes within the tumor, as determined for instance by PET imaging. This approach requires that PET imaging be sensitive and specific enough to image various biological pathways of interest, e.g. tumor metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia. In this framework, a validation of PET imaging used for adaptive radiotherapy was undertaken in animal models by comparing small-animal PET images (2.7 mm resolution) with autoradiography (AR) (100 $\mu$m resolution) in various tumors under various physiological situations. Methods: A specific template for tumor-bearing mouse imaging has been designed (Christian, R{\&}O, 2008). It allows for the registration between MRI images (Biospec, Bruker), FDG-PET images (Mosaic, Philips) and AR (FLA-5100, Fujifilm). After registration, the tumors on the PET and AR images were segmented using a threshold-based method. The thresholds were selected to obtain absolute equal volumes in the PET and AR images. Matching indexes were then calculated between the various volumes. The entire imaging process was performed for FSAII tumors (n = 5), SCCVII (n = 5) and irradiated (35 Gy) FSAII tumors (n = 5). Results: In regions with high FDG activity delineated using high value thresholds, low matching values of 39{\%} ± 11{\%} (mean ± SD) were observed between the volumes delineated on the PET images and those delineated on AR. The matching values progressively increased when considering larger volumes obtained with lower thresholds. These findings were independent of tumor type, tumor metabolism or tumor size. The relationship between the matching values and the percentage of overall tumor volume was fitted through a power regression (r = 0.93). As shown by simulations, the matching improved with higher PET resolution. The results can be extrapolated to human tumors imaged with a whole-body PET system. Conclusion: Discrepancies were found between the PET images and the underlying microscopic reality represented by AR images. These differences, attributed to the finite resolution of PET, were important when considering small and highly active regions of the tumors. Dose painting based on PET images should therefore be carefully considered and should take these limitations into account. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using flurodeoxyglucose and florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2{\%}) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p {\textless} 0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p {\textless} 0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep learning as a practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker.},

These recommendations should ultimately assist referring physicians faced with the task of ordering appropriate imaging tests in particular patients with TBI for whom they are providing care. These recommendations should also help radiologists advise their clinical colleagues on appropriate imaging utilization for patients with TBI.},

Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that brain networks degrade during symptomatic AD. It is unclear to what extent these degradations exist before symptomatic onset. In this study, we investigated graph theory metrics of functional integration (path length), functional segregation (clustering coefficient), and functional distinctness (modularity) as a function of disease severity. Further, we assessed whether these graph metrics were affected in cognitively normal participants with cerebrospinal fluid evidence of preclinical AD. Clustering coefficient and modularity, but not path length, were reduced in AD. Cognitively normal participants who harbored AD biomarker pathology also showed reduced values in these graph measures, demonstrating brain changes similar to, but smaller than, symptomatic AD. Only modularity was significantly affected by age. We also demonstrate that AD has a particular effect on hub-like regions in the brain. We conclude that AD causes large-scale disconnection that is present before onset of symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In the context of bivariate recurrent event data, furthermore, such susceptibilities may be different according to the type of event. We propose a joint model including both two intensity functions and two cure rate functions. Bivariate frailty effects are adopted to model the correlation between recurrent events. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximizing the likelihood derived under a piecewise constant hazard assumption. According to simulation results, the proposed method brings unbiased estimates while the model ignoring cure rate models gives underestimated covariate effects and overestimated variance estimates.

Ordinary maximum likelihood estimation and the method of moment estimation often do not work properly due to restrictions on parameters. We examine the performance of adjusted estimation methods along with the ordinary maximum likelihood estimation and the method of moment estimation by simulation and real data application. We also see the effect of the initial value in estimation methods. The simulation results show that the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator is significantly affected by the initial value; in addition, the adjusted estimators have smaller root mean square error than ordinary estimators as well as less impact on the initial value. With real datasets, we obtain similar results to what we see in simulation studies. Based on the results of simulation and real data application, we suggest using adjusted maximum likelihood estimates with adjusted method of moment estimates as initial values to estimate the parameters of normal inverse Gaussian distribution.},

abstract = {While computerised tomography (CT) may have been the first imaging tool to study human brain, it has not yet been implemented into clinical decision making process for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, with the nature of being prevalent, inexpensive and non-invasive, CT does present diagnostic features of AD to a great extent. This study explores the significance and impact on the application of the burgeoning deep learning techniques to the task of classification of CT brain images, in particular utilising convolutional neural network (CNN), aiming at providing supplementary information for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Towards this end, three categories of CT images (N = 285) are clustered into three groups, which are AD, lesion (e.g. tumour) and normal ageing. In addition, considering the characteristics of this collection with larger thickness along the direction of depth (z) ({\~{}}3–5 mm), an advanced CNN architecture is established integrating both 2D and 3D CNN networks. The fusion of the two CNN networks is subsequently coordinated based on the average of Softmax scores obtained from both networks consolidating 2D images along spatial axial directions and 3D segmented blocks respectively. As a result, the classification accuracy rates rendered by this elaborated CNN architecture are 85.2{\%}, 80{\%} and 95.3{\%} for classes of AD, lesion and normal respectively with an average of 87.6{\%}. Additionally, this improved CNN network appears to outperform the others when in comparison with 2D version only of CNN network as well as a number of state of the art hand-crafted approaches. As a result, these approaches deliver accuracy rates in percentage of 86.3, 85.6 ± 1.10, 86.3 ± 1.04, 85.2 ± 1.60, 83.1 ± 0.35 for 2D CNN, 2D SIFT, 2D KAZE, 3D SIFT and 3D KAZE respectively. The two major contributions of the paper constitute a new 3-D approach while applying deep learning technique to extract signature information rooted in both 2D slices and 3D blocks of CT images and an elaborated hand-crated approach of 3D KAZE.},

abstract = {Applied to delay discounting data, Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) provides an atheoretical index of the rate of delay discounting. The conventional method of calculating AUC, by summing the areas of the trapezoids formed by successive delay-indifference point pairings, does not account for the fact that most delay discounting tasks scale delay pseudoexponentially, that is, time intervals between delays typically get larger as delays get longer. This results in a disproportionate contribution of indifference points at long delays to the total AUC, with minimal contribution from indifference points at short delays. We propose two modifications that correct for this imbalance via a base-10 logarithmic transformation and an ordinal scaling transformation of delays. These newly proposed indices of discounting, AUClogd and AUCord, address the limitation of AUC while preserving a primary strength (remaining atheoretical). Re-examination of previously published data provides empirical support for both AUClogd and AUCord. Thus, we believe theoretical and empirical arguments favor these methods as the preferred atheoretical indices of delay discounting.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis has become a powerful tool for probing the human brain function and its breakdown in neuropsychiatry disorders. So far, most studies adopted resting-state paradigm to examine functional connectivity networks in the brain, thanks to its low demand and high tolerance that are essential for clinical studies. However, the test–retest reliability of resting-state connectivity measures is moderate, potentially due to its low behavioral constraint. On the other hand, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms, an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity, could potentially improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the test–retest reliability of functional connectivity measures during a natural viewing condition, and benchmarked it against resting-state connectivity measures acquired within the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. We found that the reliability of connectivity and graph theoretical measures of brain networks is significantly improved during natural viewing conditions over resting-state conditions, with an average increase of almost 50{\%} across various connectivity measures. Not only sensory networks for audio–visual processing become more reliable, higher order brain networks, such as default mode and attention networks, but also appear to show higher reliability during natural viewing. Our results support the use of natural viewing paradigms in estimating functional connectivity of brain networks, and have important implications for clinical application of fMRI.},

A number of studies have proposed using resting-state BOLD data to parcellate the brain into functional subunits. In this work, we present two state-of-the-art graph-based partitioning approaches, and investigate their application to the problem of brain network segmentation using resting-state fMRI. The two approaches, the normalized cut (Ncut) and the modularity detection algorithm, are also compared to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach. We show that the Ncut approach performs consistently better than the modularity detection approach, and it also outperforms the GMM approach for in vivo fMRI data. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 43 healthy subjects, and the Ncut algorithm was used to parcellate several different cortical regions of interest. The group-wise delineation of the functional subunits based on resting-state fMRI was highly consistent with the parcellation results from two task-based fMRI studies (one with 18 subjects and the other with 20 subjects). The findings suggest that whole-brain parcellation of the cortex using resting-state fMRI is feasible, and that the Ncut algorithm provides the appropriate technique for this task. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Imaging with amyloid-$\beta$ PET can potentially aid the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetaben ( 18F) is a promising 18F-labelled amyloid-$\beta$-targeted PET tracer in clinical development. We aimed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of florbetaben ( 18F) PET in discriminating between patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and elderly healthy controls. Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised phase 2 study in 18 centres in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and the USA. Imaging with florbetaben ( 18F) PET was done on patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (age 55 years or older, mini-mental state examination [MMSE] score=18-26, clinical dementia rating [CDR]=0{\textperiodcentered}5-2{\textperiodcentered}0) and age-matched healthy controls (MMSE ≥28, CDR=0). Our primary objective was to establish the diagnostic efficacy of the scans in differentiating between patients with probable disease and age-matched healthy controls on the basis of neocortical tracer uptake pattern 90-110 min post-injection. PET images were assessed visually by three readers masked to the clinical diagnosis and all other clinical findings, and quantitatively by use of pre-established brain volumes of interest to obtain standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs), taking the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00750282. Findings: 81 participants with probable Alzheimer's disease and 69 healthy controls were assessed. Independent visual assessment of the PET scans showed a sensitivity of 80{\%} (95{\%} CI 71-89) and a specificity of 91{\%} (84-98) for discriminating participants with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. The SUVRs in all neocortical grey-matter regions in participants with Alzheimer's disease were significantly higher (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) compared with the healthy controls, with the posterior cingulate being the best discriminator. Linear discriminant analysis of regional SUVRs yielded a sensitivity of 85{\%} and a specificity of 91{\%}. Regional SUVRs also correlated well with scores of cognitive impairment such as the MMSE and the word-list memory and word-list recall scores (r -0{\textperiodcentered}27 to -0{\textperiodcentered}33, p≤0{\textperiodcentered}021). APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 was more common in participants with positive PET images compared with those with negative scans (65{\%} vs 22{\%} [p=0{\textperiodcentered}027] in patients with Alzheimer's disease; 50{\%} vs 16{\%} [p=0{\textperiodcentered}074] in healthy controls). No safety concerns were noted. Interpretation: We provide verification of the efficacy, safety, and biological relevance of florbetaben ( 18F) amyloid-$\beta$ PET and suggest its potential as a visual adjunct in the diagnostic algorithm of dementia.

abstract = {Brain changes reminiscent of Alzheimer disease (AD) have been previously reported in a substantial portion of elderly cognitive healthy (HC) subjects. The major aim was to evaluate the accuracy of MRI assessed regional gray matter (GM) volume, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and neuropsychological test scores to identify those HC subjects who subsequently convert to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia. We obtained in 54 healthy control (HC) subjects a priori defined region of interest (ROI) values of medial temporal and parietal FDG-PET and medial temporal GM volume. In logistic regression analyses, these ROI values were tested together with neuropsychological test scores (free recall, trail making test B (TMT-B)) as predictors of HC conversion during a clinical follow-up between 3 and 4 years. In voxel-based analyses, FDG-PET and MRI GM maps were compared between HC converters and HC non-converters. Out of the 54 HC subjects, 11 subjects converted to MCI or AD dementia. Lower FDG-PET ROI values were associated with higher likelihood of conversion (p = 0.004), with the area under the curve (AUC) yielding 82.0{\%} (95{\%} CI = (95.5{\%}, 68.5{\%})). The GM volume ROI was not a significant predictor (p = 0.07). TMT-B but not the free recall tests were a significant predictor (AUC = 71{\%} (95{\%} CI = 50.4{\%}, 91.7{\%})). For the combination of FDG-PET and TMT-B, the AUC was 93.4{\%} (sensitivity = 82{\%}, specificity = 93{\%}). Voxel-based group comparison showed reduced FDG-PET metabolism within the temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortex in HC converters. In conclusion, medial temporal and-parietal FDG-PET and executive function show a clinically acceptable accuracy for predicting clinical progression in elderly HC subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes are potential candidates for subunit vaccine design for various diseases. Most of the existing T cell epitope prediction methods are indirect methods that predict MHC class I binders instead of CTL epitopes. In this study, a systematic attempt has been made to develop a direct method for predicting CTL epitopes from an antigenic sequence. This method is based on quantitative matrix (QM) and machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This method has been trained and tested on non-redundant dataset of T cell epitopes and non-epitopes that includes 1137 experimentally proven MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes. The accuracy of QM-, ANN- and SVM-based methods was 70.0, 72.2 and 75.2{\%}, respectively. The performance of these methods has been evaluated through Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) at a cutoff score where sensitivity and specificity was nearly equal. Finally, both machine-learning methods were used for consensus and combined prediction of CTL epitopes. The performances of these methods were evaluated on blind dataset where machine learning-based methods perform better than QM-based method. We also demonstrated through subgroup analysis that our methods can discriminate between T-cell epitopes and MHC binders (non-epitopes). In brief this method allows prediction of CTL epitopes using QM, SVM, ANN approaches. The method also facilitates prediction of MHC restriction in predicted T cell epitopes.

The striking similarity of the two problems in this framework allows us to design and analyze algorithms for both simultaneously, and to easily adapt algorithms designed for one problem to the other. For both problems, we give new algorithms and explain their potential advantages over existing methods. These algorithms are iterative and can be divided into two types based on whether the parameters are updated sequentially (one at a time) or in parallel (all at once). We also describe a parameterized family of algorithms that includes both a sequential- and a parallel-update algorithm as special cases, thus showing how the sequential and parallel approaches can themselves be unified. For all of the algorithms, we give convergence proofs using a general formalization of the auxiliary-function proof technique. As one of our sequential-update algorithms is equivalent to AdaBoost, this provides the first general proof of convergence for AdaBoost. We show that all of our algorithms generalize easily to the multiclass case, and we contrast the new algorithms with the iterative scaling algorithm. We conclude with a few experimental results with synthetic data that highlight the behavior of the old and newly proposed algorithms in different settings.},

abstract = {Lung nodules are small, round, or oval-shaped masses of tissue in the lung region. Early diagnosis and treatment of lung nodules can significantly improve the quality of patients' lives. Because of their small size and the interlaced nature of chest anatomy, detection of lung nodules using different medical imaging techniques becomes challenging. Recently, several methods for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) were proposed to improve the detection of lung nodules with good performances. However, the current methods are unable to achieve high sensitivity and high specificity. In this paper, we propose using deep feature fusion from the non-medical training and hand-crafted features to reduce the false positive results. Based on our experimentation of the public dataset, our results show that, the deep fusion feature can achieve promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity (69.3{\%} and 96.2{\%}) at 1.19 false positive per image, which is better than the single hand-crafted features (62{\%} and 95.4{\%}) at 1.45 false positive per image. As it stands, fusion features that were used to classify our candidate nodules have resulted in a more promising outcome as compared to the single features from deep learning features and the hand-crafted features. This will improve the current CAD method based on the use of deep feature fusion to more effectively diagnose the presence of lung nodules.},

abstract = {Brain functional connectivity (FC) network, estimated with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) technique, has emerged as a promising approach for accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the conventional FC network is essentially low-order in the sense that only the correlations among brain regions (in terms of RS-fMRI time series) are taken into account. The features derived from this type of brain network may fail to serve as an effective disease biomarker. To overcome this drawback, we propose extraction of novel high-order FC correlations that characterize how the low-order correlations between different pairs of brain regions interact with each other. Specifically, for each brain region, a sliding window approach is first performed over the entire RS-fMRI time series to generate multiple short overlapping segments. For each segment, a low-order FC network is constructed, measuring the short-term correlation between brain regions. These low-order networks (obtained from all segments) describe the dynamics of short-term FC along the time, thus also forming the correlation time series for every pair of brain regions. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we further group the correlation time series into a small number of different clusters according to their intrinsic common patterns. Then, the correlation between the respective mean correlation time series of different clusters is calculated to represent the high-order correlation among different pairs of brain regions. Finally, we design a pattern classifier, by combining features of both low-order and high-order FC networks. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the high-order FC network on disease diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3282–3296, 2016. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the important tradeoff between privacy and learnability, when designing algorithms for learning from private databases. We focus on privacy-preserving logistic regression. First we apply an idea of Dwork et al. [6] to design a privacy-preserving logistic regression algorithm. This involves bounding the sensitivity of regularized logistic regression, and perturbing the learned classifier with noise proportional to the sensitivity. We then provide a privacy-preserving regularized logistic regression algorithm based on a new privacy-preserving technique: solving a perturbed optimization problem. We prove that our algorithm preserves privacy in the model due to [6]. We provide learning guarantees for both algorithms, which are tighter for our new algorithm, in cases in which one would typically apply logistic regression. Experiments demonstrate improved learning performance of our method, versus the sensitivity method. Our privacy-preserving technique does not depend on the sensitivity of the function, and extends easily to a class of convex loss functions. Our work also reveals an interesting connection between regularization and privacy.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), while still at the stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is important for the development of new treatments. However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.},

abstract = {Artifactual sources of resting-state (RS) FMRI can originate from head motion, physiology, and hardware. Of these sources, motion has received considerable attention and was found to induce corrupting effects by differentially biasing correlations between regions depending on their distance. Numerous corrective approaches have relied on the identification and censoring of high-motion time points and the use of the brain-wide average time series as a nuisance regressor to which the data are orthogonalized (Global Signal Regression, GSReg). We replicate the previously reported head-motion bias on correlation coefficients and then show that while motion can be the source of artifact in correlations, the distance-dependent bias is exacerbated by GSReg. Put differently, correlation estimates obtained after GSReg are more susceptible to the presence of motion and by extension to the levels of censoring. More generally, the effect of motion on correlation estimates depends on the preprocessing steps leading to the correlation estimate, with certain approaches performing markedly worse than others. For this purpose, we consider various models for RS FMRI preprocessing and show that the local white matter regressor (WMe, a subset of ANATICOR, results in minimal sensitivity to motion and reduces by extension the dependence of correlation results on censoring. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hang Joon Jo et al.},

abstract = {Predicting outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury is critically important for making sound clinical decisions. This study aimed at determining the prognostic value of the Rotterdam scoring system to predict early death among these patients. Materials and Methods This study was performed prospectively on 150 patients with traumatic brain injury hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, mechanism of trauma, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and accompanying lesions were documented. A brain computed tomography was performed for each patient and scored by use of the Rotterdam system. Patients were monitored for 2 weeks after hospital discharge, and their outcomes were documented. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis and prognostic values of Rotterdam system were conducted by SPSS software. Results Nineteen patients (12.7{\%}) died during the course of the study. The mean age of the dead patients was significantly greater than those who survived (P = 0.037). The sensitivity and the specificity of the Rotterdam scoring system at the cutoff score of 4 were 84.2{\%} and 96.2{\%}, respectively. Rotterdam score was significantly correlated with patient outcomes (P {\textless} 0.0001). Moreover, logistic regression analyses revealed that factors such as age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Rotterdam score significantly contributed to patient outcomes. Conclusions Rotterdam score is an independent factor for predicting outcomes among patients with traumatic brain injury. At the cutoff score of 4, the Rotterdam system can predict outcomes among patients suffering from traumatic brain injury with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract = {Aims Physiopathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still matter of debate. Especially the role of amyloid $\beta$ and tau pathology in the development of the disease are still matter of debate. Changes in tau and amyloid $\beta$ peptide concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hypometabolic patterns at fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET scanning are considered as biomarkers of AD. The present study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between the concentrations of CSF total Tau (t-Tau), phosphorilated Tau (p-Tau) and A$\beta$1–42 amyloid peptide with 18F-FDG brain distribution in a group of patients with AD. Materials and methods We examined 131 newly diagnosed AD patients according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and 20 healthy controls. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 70 (±7) years; 57 were male and 74 were female. All patients and controls underwent a complete clinical investigation, including medical history, neurological examination, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a complete blood screening (including routine exams, thyroid hormones and a complete neuropsychological evaluation). Structural MRI was performed not earlier than 1 month before the 18F-FDG PET/CT. The following patients were excluded: those with isolated deficits and/or unmodified MMSE (=25/30) on revisit (period of follow-up: 6, 12 and 18 months); patients who had had a clinically manifest acute stroke in the last 6 months with a Hachinsky score greater than 4; and patients with radiological evidence of subcortical lesions. All AD patients were taken off cholinesterase inhibitor treatment throughout the study. We performed lumbar puncture and CSF sampling for diagnostic purposes 2 weeks (±2 days) before the PET/CT scan. The relationship between brain F-FDG uptake and CSF biomarkers was analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in Matlab R2012b using the MMSE score, sex and age, and other CSF biomarkers as covariates. Results t-Tau, p-Tau and A$\beta$(1–42) in CSF resulted 774 ± 345 pg/ml, 98 ± 64 pg/ml and 348.8 ± 111 pg/ml respectively. SPM analysis showed a significant negative correlation between CSF t-Tau and 18F FDG uptake in right temporal, parietal and frontal lobe (Brodmann areas, BA, 20, 40 and 8; P fdr and few corr {\textless} 0.001, ke 19534). We did not find any significant relationships with other CSF biomarkers. Conclusions t-Tau deposition in brain is related to temporal, parietal and frontal hypometabolism in AD.},

abstract = {High-dimensional classification methods have been a major target of machine learning for the automatic classification of patients who suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). One major issue of automatic classification is the feature-selection method from high-dimensional data. In this paper, a novel approach for statistical feature reduction and selection in high-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data based on the probability distribution function (PDF) is introduced. To develop an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique, this research explores the statistical patterns extracted from structural MRI (sMRI) data on four systematic levels. First, global and local differences of gray matter in patients with AD compared to healthy controls (HCs) using the voxel-based morphometric (VBM) technique with 3-Tesla 3D T1-weighted MRI are investigated. Second, feature extraction based on the voxel clusters detected by VBM on sMRI and voxel values as volume of interest (VOI) is used. Third, a novel statistical feature-selection process is employed, utilizing the PDF of the VOI to represent statistical patterns of the respective high-dimensional sMRI sample. Finally, the proposed feature-selection method for early detection of AD with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers compared to other standard feature selection methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) techniques, is assessed. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated using 130 AD and 130 HC MRI data from the ADNI dataset with 10-fold cross validation. The results show that the PDF-based feature selection approach is a reliable technique that is highly competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques in classifying AD from high-dimensional sMRI samples.},

Baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography of 36 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia after an average time of 2 years (pAD) and of 105 CTR were processed. The area of hypometabolism in pAD showed less metabolic connectivity in patients than in CTR (autocorrelation and correlation with large temporal and frontal areas, respectively). pAD patients showed limited correlation even in selected nonhypometabolic areas, including the hippocampi and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC). On the contrary, in CTR group correlation was highlighted between hippocampi and precuneus/posterior cingulate and frontal cortex, and between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei and parietal cortex. The reduced metabolic connections both in hypometabolic and nonhypometabolic areas in pAD patients suggest that metabolic disconnection (reflecting early diaschisis) may antedate remote hypometabolism (early sign of synaptic degeneration). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

CT is still frequently used only for attenuation correction and lesion localization. However, increasing sales of high-end scanners that combine PET with 64-detector CT strongly suggest that the field is moving toward a comprehensive concept, whereby diagnostic CT studies during intravenous contrast material application are combined with the highest-quality PET studies. At many institutions, in-line PET/CT has replaced separately acquired PET and CT examinations for many oncologic indications. This replacement has occurred despite the fact that only a relatively small number of well-designed prospective studies have verified imaging findings against the gold standard of histopathologic tissue evaluation. However, a large number of studies have used acceptable reference standards, such as pathology, imaging, and other clinical follow-up findings, for validating PET/CT findings. From these data, we believe, has emerged reliable evidence in support of the notion that PET/CT offers diagnostic advantages over its individual components for the major cancers.

This modeling was developed using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data, and was implemented on the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho. The approach is based on explicit and quantitative environmental correlations between observed landslide occurrences, climate, parent material, and environmental attributes while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used as a measure of performance of a predictive rule. The modeling results suggest that development of two independent models for road related and non-road related landslide hazard was necessary because spatial prediction and predictor variables were different for these models.

To determine accuracy, we compared logistic regression results to a geriatrician's diagnosis of MCI or dementia that included Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed dementia. We found that the addition of EEG (non-linear complexity) to a logistic model that included both neuropsychological assessment (ADAS-Cog) and cardiovascular history increased overall accuracy from 80{\%} to 92{\%}. The logistic model identified dementia and MCI as a single group comprised of the following subgroups (with accuracies): Alzheimer's disease (92{\%}; 12/13), vascular dementia (73{\%}; 8/11), mixed dementia (100{\%}; 4/4), and mild cognitive impairment (80{\%}; 4/5). Whereas the analysis is limited by small sample sizes and mixing of diverse pathologies, the findings do provide support that the subgroups may share changes in neuropsychological, cardiovascular, and electroencephalographic factors (specifically ADAS-Cog total score, cardiovascular history, and EEG complexity). Taken together, the study results provide support that EEG might complement the clinician's evaluation of dementia and MCI. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The current study tested the accuracy of primary MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker candidates and neuropsychological tests for predicting the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. In a cross-validation paradigm, predictor models were estimated in the training set of AD (N = 81) and elderly control subjects (N = 101). A combination of CSF t-tau/A$\beta$1-4 ratio and MRI biomarkers or neuropsychological tests (free recall and trail making test B (TMT-B)) showed the best statistical fit in the AD vs. HC comparison, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 64{\%} when applied to the prediction of MCI conversion (3.3-year observation interval, mean = 2.3 years). However, several single-predictor models showed a predictive accuracy of MCI conversion comparable to that of any multipredictor model. The best single predictors were right entorhinal cortex (prediction accuracy = 68.5{\%} (95{\%} CI (59.5, 77.4))) and TMT-B test (prediction accuracy 64.6{\%} (95{\%} CI (55.5, 73.4{\%}))). In conclusion, short-term conversion to AD is predicted by single marker models to a comparable degree as by multimarker models in amnestic MCI subjects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The study of brain networks by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a promising method for identifying patients with dementia from healthy controls (HC). Using graph theory, different aspects of the brain network can be efficiently characterized by calculating measures of integration and segregation. In this study, we combined a graph theoretical approach with advanced machine learning methods to study the brain network in 89 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 45 age-matched HC. The rs-fMRI connectivity matrix was constructed using a brain parcellation based on a 264 putative functional areas. Using the optimal features extracted from the graph measures, we were able to accurately classify three groups (i.e., HC, MCI, and AD) with accuracy of 88.4 {\%}. We also investigated performance of our proposed method for a binary classification of a group (e.g., MCI) from two other groups (e.g., HC and AD). The classification accuracies for identifying HC from AD and MCI, AD from HC and MCI, and MCI from HC and AD, were 87.3, 97.5, and 72.0 {\%}, respectively. In addition, results based on the parcellation of 264 regions were compared to that of the automated anatomical labeling atlas (AAL), consisted of 90 regions. The accuracy of classification of three groups using AAL was degraded to 83.2 {\%}. Our results show that combining the graph measures with the machine learning approach, on the basis of the rs-fMRI connectivity analysis, may assist in diagnosis of AD and MCI.},

abstract = {Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), has attracted more and more attention recently. So far, multiple biomarkers have been shown to be sensitive to the diagnosis of AD and MCI, i.e., structural MR imaging (MRI) for brain atrophy measurement, functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET) for hypometabolism quantification, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for quantification of specific proteins. However, most existing research focuses on only a single modality of biomarkers for diagnosis of AD and MCI, although recent studies have shown that different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of AD and MCI. In this paper, we propose to combine three modalities of biomarkers, i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers, to discriminate between AD (or MCI) and healthy controls, using a kernel combination method. Specifically, ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 51. AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI converters who had converted to AD within 18. months and 56 MCI non-converters who had not converted to AD within 18. months), and 52 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed multimodal classification method. In particular, for each MR or FDG-PET image, 93 volumetric features are extracted from the 93 regions of interest (ROIs), automatically labeled by an atlas warping algorithm. For CSF biomarkers, their original values are directly used as features. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to evaluate the classification accuracy, using a 10-fold cross-validation. As a result, for classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 93.2{\%} (with a sensitivity of 93{\%} and a specificity of 93.3{\%}) when combining all three modalities of biomarkers, and only 86.5{\%} when using even the best individual modality of biomarkers. Similarly, for classifying MCI from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 76.4{\%} (with a sensitivity of 81.8{\%} and a specificity of 66{\%}) for our combined method, and only 72{\%} even using the best individual modality of biomarkers. Further analysis on MCI sensitivity of our combined method indicates that 91.5{\%} of MCI converters and 73.4{\%} of MCI non-converters are correctly classified. Moreover, we also evaluate the classification performance when employing a feature selection method to select the most discriminative MR and FDG-PET features. Again, our combined method shows considerably better performance, compared to the case of using an individual modality of biomarkers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In several neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively called tauopathies, progressive accumulation of tau in the brain is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Noninvasive detection of tau protein deposits in the brain would be useful to diagnose tauopathies as well as to track and predict disease progression. Recently, several tau PET tracers including T807, THK-5117, and PBB3 have been developed and succeeded in imaging neurofibrillary pathology in vivo. For use of tau PET as a biomarker of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, PET tracers should have high affinity to PHF-tau and high selectivity for tau over amyloid-$\beta$ and other protein deposits. PET tau imaging enables the longitudinal assessment of the spatial pattern of tau deposition and its relation to amyloid-$\beta$ pathology and neurodegeneration. This technology could also be applied to the pharmacological assessment of anti-tau therapy, thereby allowing preventive interventions.},

abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

abstract = {Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has drawn the attention of computer vision research community over the last few years. Several attempts have been made to adapt pattern recognition approaches to specific neuroimaging data such as Structural MRI (sMRI) for early AD diagnosis. One strategy is to boost the discrimination power of such approaches by integrating complementary imaging modalities in a single learning framework. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a new and promising modality giving complementary information to the anatomical MRI. However, including relevant DTI information from such modality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to extract local image-derived biomarkers from DTI and sMRI to construct multimodal AD signatures. To assess the relevance of such modalities as well as to optimize the classifier, we integrate complementary information using a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework for AD subjects recognition. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on a subset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Both T1-weighted MRI and Mean Diffusivity (MD) maps from the DTI modality of 45 AD patients, 52 Normal Control (NC) and 58 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects have been used. The obtained results indicate that our multimodal approach yields significant improvement in accuracy over using each single modality independently. The classification accuracies obtained by the proposed method are 90.2{\%}, 79.42{\%} and 76.63{\%} for respectively AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and AD vs. MCI binary classification problems. For the MCI classification problem, the proposed fusion framework leads to an average increase about at least 9{\%} for the accuracy, 5{\%} for the specificity and 15{\%} for the sensitivity.},

abstract = {In the past decade, resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) measures of brain activity have attracted considerable attention. Based on changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, R-fMRI offers a novel way to assess the brain's spontaneous or intrinsic (i.e., task-free) activity with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The properties of both the intra- and inter-regional connectivity of resting-state brain activity have been well documented, promoting our understanding of the brain as a complex network. Specifically, the topological organization of brain networks has been recently studied with graph theory. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in graph-based brain network analyses of R-fMRI signals, both in typical and atypical populations. Application of these approaches to R-fMRI data has demonstrated non-trivial topological properties of functional networks in the human brain. Among these is the knowledge that the brain's intrinsic activity is organized as a small-world, highly efficient network, with significant modularity and highly connected hub regions. These network properties have also been found to change throughout normal development, aging, and in various pathological conditions. The literature reviewed here suggests that graph-based network analyses are capable of uncovering system-level changes associated with different processes in the resting brain, which could provide novel insights into the understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of brain function. We also highlight several potential research topics in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wang, Zuo and He.},

abstract = {Whole-brain anatomical connectivity in living humans can be modeled as a network with diffusion-MRI and tractography. Network nodes are associated with distinct grey-matter regions, while white-matter fiber bundles serve as interconnecting network links. However, the lack of a gold standard for regional parcellation in brain MRI makes the definition of nodes arbitrary, meaning that network nodes are defined using templates employing either random or anatomical parcellation criteria. Consequently, the number of nodes included in networks studied by different authors has varied considerably, from less than 100 up to more than 104. Here, we systematically and quantitatively assess the behavior, structure and topological attributes of whole-brain anatomical networks over a wide range of nodal scales, a variety of grey-matter parcellations as well as different diffusion-MRI acquisition protocols. We show that simple binary decisions about network organization, such as whether small-worldness or scale-freeness is evident, are unaffected by spatial scale, and that the estimates of various organizational parameters (e.g. small-worldness, clustering, path length, and efficiency) are consistent across different parcellation scales at the same resolution (i.e. the same number of nodes). However, these parameters vary considerably as a function of spatial scale; for example small-worldness exhibited a difference of 95{\%} between the widely-used automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template (∼ 100 nodes) and a 4000-node random parcellation ($\sigma$AAL = 1.9 vs. $\sigma$4000 = 53.6 ± 2.2). These findings indicate that any comparison of network parameters across studies must be made with reference to the spatial scale of the nodal parcellation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Increasing evidence suggests vascular risk factors (VRF) play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have found associations between VRF and risk of AD. Treating VRF in patients with AD offers a potential treatment option but ineffective treatments should be avoided in this group who are frequently on multiple medications and in whom compliance may be challenging. Methods: Studies containing information on the treatment of VRF in patients with a diagnosis of AD were identified using a defined search strategy. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were included. Results: The pre-specified search strategy retrieved 11,992 abstract articles, and 25 papers including those identified on review of reference lists and reviews met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. Observational studies suggested that a VRF package and treatment of hypertension and statin therapy may be associated with improved outcome but these studies suffered from potential bias. The few RCTs performed were mostly small with short duration follow-up, and do not provide clear evidence either way. Conclusions: Observational data raises the possibility that treating VRF could alter the rate of decline in AD. However RCT data are not yet available to support this hypothesis and to alter clinical practice. RCTs in larger numbers of individuals with longer follow-up, ideally in the early stages of AD, are required to address this potentially important treatment question.},

Three groups of age, education, and gender matched NL, MCI, and AD subjects were studied. The results supported the hypotheses: 1) entorhinal cortex MRglu and hippocampal volume were most accurate in classifying NL and MCI; 2) both imaging modalities identified the temporal neocortex as best separating MCI and AD, whereas widespread changes accurately classified NL and AD; 3) In most between group comparisons regional MRglu measures were diagnostically superior to volume measures.

However, it remains unclear how this functional connectivity is related to PCC changes. We employed resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine brain regions with a functional connection to PCC in a mild AD group compared with matched control subjects. PCC connectivity was gathered by investigating synchronic low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations with a temporal correlation method. We found asymmetric PCC-left hippocampus, right dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus connectivity disruption. In addition, some other regions such as the bilateral visual cortex, the infero-temporal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal cortex, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus showed decreased functional connectivity to the PCC. There were also some regions, primarily in the left frontal-parietal cortices, that showed increased connectivity. These regions included the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex, the left basal ganglia and the left primary motor cortex. Impairments to memory, high vision-related functions and olfaction in AD can be explained by a disruption to the functional connection of resting-state networks. The results of increased connectivity may support the compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity could plausibly provide an early imaging biomarker for AD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The world of meat faces a permanent need for new methods of meat quality evaluation. Researchers want improved techniques to deepen their understanding of meat features. Expectations of consumers for meat quality grow constantly, which induces the necessity of quality control at the levels of slaughtering, meat cutting, and distribution. This article is focused on techniques intended to predict technological and sensory qualities from measurements carried out on fresh intact meat. pH has been measured for a long time, but its on-line determination still progresses through automation. In the laboratory, NMR provides new insights on WHC mechanisms. Image processing has considerably improved the assessment of meat appearance. Developments of techniques for prediction of toughness are in progress, either directly, through ultrasonic analysis or NIR reflectance, or indirectly, through determination of connective tissue content by fluorescence probes. Control of authenticity benefits from the last developments of molecular biology and analytical chemistry. However, implementation of methods for meat quality evaluation has been very limited in the industry. The reasons for that situation are analyzed. Among the techniques recently described, the most promising for large-scale meat quality evaluation are considered to be ultrasonic analysis, image processing and NIR spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {PET has the invaluable advantage of being intrinsically quantitative, enabling accurate measurements of tracer concentrations in vivo. In PET tumor imaging, indices characterizing tumor uptake, such as standardized uptake values, are becoming increasingly important, especially in the context of monitoring the response to therapy. However, when tracer uptake in small tumors is measured, large biases can be introduced by the partial-volume effect (PVE). The purposes of this article are to explain what PVE is and to describe its consequences in PET tumor imaging. The parameters on which PVE depends are reviewed. Actions that can be taken to reduce the errors attributable to PVE are described. Various PVE correction schemes are presented, and their applicability to PET tumor imaging is discussed.

abstract = {Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture. Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls. Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity. Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.},

abstract = {Elevated urinary albumin excretion in patients with type 1 diabetes reverts to normoalbuminuria in a majority of patients but advances toward proteinuria in some. In order to gain valuable insights into the early pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy we evaluated the association of kidney tubular injury biomarkers with changes in albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Urine levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N-acetyl-Β-D- glucosaminidase (NAG), and some inflammatory markers were determined in 38 healthy individuals and 659 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus having varying degrees of albuminuria. Urinary interleukin-6, CXCL10/IP-10, NAG, and KIM-1 levels were very low in healthy individuals, increased in type 1 patients with normoalbuminuria, and were highest in diabetic patients that had microalbuminuria. Low baseline concentrations of urinary KIM-1 and NAG both individually and collectively were significantly associated with the regression of microalbuminuria over the subsequent 2 years; an effect independent of clinical characteristics. Progression and regression of microalbuminuria were unrelated to urinary levels of interleukins 6 and 8, CXCL10/IP-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Thus our results show that lower urinary KIM-1 and NAG levels were associated with the regression of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hence, tubular dysfunction is a critical component of the early course of diabetic nephropathy. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society of Nephrology.},

The goal of this study was to compare FDG-PET and clinical measurements in a large sample of elderly subjects with memory disturbance. We examined relationships between glucose metabolism in FDG-PET regions of interest (FDG-ROIs), and ADAS-cog and FAQ scores in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Low glucose metabolism at baseline predicted subsequent ADAS-cog and FAQ decline. In addition, longitudinal glucose metabolism decline was associated with concurrent ADAS-cog and FAQ decline. Finally, a power analysis revealed that FDG-ROI values have greater statistical power than ADAS-cog to detect attenuation of cognitive decline in AD and MCI patients. Glucose metabolism is a sensitive measure of change in cognition and functional ability in AD and MCI, and has value in predicting future cognitive decline. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The spatial scan statistic is a widely used method to detect spatial clusters. The method imposes a large number of scanning windows with pre-defined shapes and varying sizes on the entire study region. The likelihood ratio test statistic comparing inside versus outside each window is then calculated and the window with the maximum value of test statistic becomes the most likely cluster. The results of cluster detection respond sensitively to the shape and the maximum size of scanning windows. The shape of scanning window has been extensively studied; however, there has been relatively little attention on the maximum scanning window size (MSWS) or maximum reported cluster size (MRCS). The Gini coefficient has recently been proposed by Han et al. (International Journal of Health Geographics, 15, 27, 2016) as a powerful tool to determine the optimal value of MRCS for the Poisson-based spatial scan statistic. In this paper, we apply the Gini coefficient to normal-based spatial scan statistics. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the method using a real data example of female colorectal cancer incidence rates in South Korea for the year 2009.},

abstract = {Background: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Behavior Section (ADAS-cog), a measure of cognitive performance, has been used widely in Alzheimer's disease trials. Its key role in clinical trials should be supported by evidence that it is both clinically meaningful and scientifically sound. Its conceptual and neuropsychological underpinnings are well-considered, but its performance as an instrument of measurement has received less attention. Objective: To examine the traditional psychometric properties of the ADAS-cog in a large sample of people with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Data from three clinical trials of donepezil (Aricept) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (n=1421; MMSE 10-26) were analysed at both the scale and component level. Five psychometric properties were examined using traditional psychometric methods. These methods of examination underpin upcoming Food and Drug Administration recommendations for patient rating scale evaluation. Results: At the scale-level, criteria tested for data completeness, scaling assumptions (eg, component total correlations: 0.39-0.67), targeting (no floor or ceiling effects), reliability (eg, Cronbach's $\alpha$: = 0.84; test-retest intraclass correlations: 0.93) and validity (correlation with MMSE: -0.63) were satisfied. At the component level, 7 of 11 ADAS-cog components had substantial ceiling effects (range 40-64{\%}). Conclusions: Performance was satisfactory at the scale level, but most ADAS-cog components were too easy for many patients in this sample and did not reflect the expected depth and range of cognitive performance. The clinical implication of this finding is that the ADAS-cog's estimate of cognitive ability, and its potential ability to detect differences in cognitive performance under treatment, could be improved. However, because of the limitations of traditional psychometric methods, further evaluations would be desirable using additional rating scale analysis techniques to pinpoint specific improvements.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in early assessment of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Marshall and Rotterdam are the mostly used scoring systems, in which CT findings are grouped differently. We sought to determine the scoring system and initial CT findings predicting the death at hospital discharge (early death) in patients with TBI. Materials and Methods: We included 245 consecutive adult patients with mild-to-severe TBI. Their initial CT and status at hospital discharge (dead or alive) were reviewed, and both CT scores were calculated. We examined whether each score was related to early death; compared the two scoring systems' performance in predicting early death, and identified the CT findings that are independent predictors of early death. Results: More deaths occurred among patients with higher Marshall and Rotterdam scores (both P{\textless}.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) indicated that both scoring systems had similarly good discriminative power in predicting early death (Marshall, AUC=0. 85 vs. Rotterdam, AUC=0.85). Basal cistern absence (odds ratio [OR]=771.5, P{\textless}.0001), positive midline shift (OR=56.2, P=.0011), hemorrhagic mass volume≥25mL (OR=12.9, P=.0065), and intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR=3.8, P=.0395) were independent predictors of early death. Conclusions: Both Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems can be used to predict early death in patients with TBI. The performance of the Marshall score is at least equal to that of the Rotterdam score. Thus, although older, the Marshall score remains useful in predicting patients' prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2014 AUR.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase in which amyloid and tau cerebral pathology accumulate without producing cognitive symptoms. Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that brain networks degrade during symptomatic AD. It is unclear to what extent these degradations exist before symptomatic onset. In this study, we investigated graph theory metrics of functional integration (path length), functional segregation (clustering coefficient), and functional distinctness (modularity) as a function of disease severity. Further, we assessed whether these graph metrics were affected in cognitively normal participants with cerebrospinal fluid evidence of preclinical AD. Clustering coefficient and modularity, but not path length, were reduced in AD. Cognitively normal participants who harbored AD biomarker pathology also showed reduced values in these graph measures, demonstrating brain changes similar to, but smaller than, symptomatic AD. Only modularity was significantly affected by age. We also demonstrate that AD has a particular effect on hub-like regions in the brain. We conclude that AD causes large-scale disconnection that is present before onset of symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

A statistically significant overlap between the resting-state functional connectivity map and the task-activation map due to bilateral finger tapping was obtained. Similar results have been obtained in the auditory and visual cortex. Because the pulse sequence used for collecting data was sensitive to blood flow and blood oxygenation, these low-frequency fluctuations of signal intensity may have arisen from variations of both. The objective of this study was simultaneously to determine the contribution of the blood oxygenation level signal and the flow signal to physiological fluctuations in the resting brain using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery pulse sequence. In all subjects, the functional connectivity maps obtained from BOLD had a greater coincidence with task-activation maps than the corresponding functional connectivity maps obtained from blood-flow signals at the same level of statistical significance. Results of this study suggest that while variations in blood flow might contribute to functional connectivity maps, BOLD signals play a dominant role in the mechanism that gives rise to functional connectivity in the resting human brain.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that cognitive and memory decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is coupled with losses of small-world attributes. However, few studies have investigated the characteristics of the whole brain networks in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the topological properties of the whole brain networks in 18 AD patients, 16 MCI patients, and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. Among the three groups, AD patients showed the longest characteristic path lengths and the largest clustering coefficients, while the small-world measures of MCI networks exhibited intermediate values. The finding was not surprising, given that MCI is considered to be the prodromal stage of AD. Compared with normal controls, MCI patients showed decreased nodal centrality mainly in the medial temporal lobe as well as increased nodal centrality in the occipital regions. In addition, we detected increased nodal centrality in the medial temporal lobe and frontal gyrus, and decreased nodal centrality mainly in the amygdala in MCI patients compared with AD patients. The results suggested a widespread rewiring in AD and MCI patients. These findings concerning AD and MCI may be an integrated reflection of reorganization of the brain networks accompanied with the cognitive decline that may lead to AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The effect of galantamine treatment on cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and nicotinic receptor binding was investigated by positron emission tomography (PET) in 18 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to galantamine concentration and the patients' cognitive performances. The first 3 months of the study was of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design, during which 12 patients received galantamine (16-24 mg/day) and 6 patients the placebo, and this was followed by 9 months' galantamine treatment in all patients. The patients underwent PET examinations to measure cortical AChE activity (11C-PMP) and 11C-nicotine binding. Neuropsychological tests were performed throughout the study. Inhibition (30-40{\%}) of cortical AChE activity was observed after 3 weeks to 12 months of galantamine treatment. No significant change in mean cortical 11C-nicotine binding was observed during the study. 11C-Nicotine binding, however, positively correlated with plasma galantamine concentration. Both the changes of AChE activity and 11C-nicotine binding correlated positively with the results of a cognitive test of attention. In conclusion, galantamine caused sustained AChE inhibition for up to 12 months. At the individual level, the in vivo cortical AChE inhibition and 11C-nicotine binding were associated with changes in the attention domain of cognition rather than episodic memory. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Applied to delay discounting data, Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) provides an atheoretical index of the rate of delay discounting. The conventional method of calculating AUC, by summing the areas of the trapezoids formed by successive delay-indifference point pairings, does not account for the fact that most delay discounting tasks scale delay pseudoexponentially, that is, time intervals between delays typically get larger as delays get longer. This results in a disproportionate contribution of indifference points at long delays to the total AUC, with minimal contribution from indifference points at short delays. We propose two modifications that correct for this imbalance via a base-10 logarithmic transformation and an ordinal scaling transformation of delays. These newly proposed indices of discounting, AUClogd and AUCord, address the limitation of AUC while preserving a primary strength (remaining atheoretical). Re-examination of previously published data provides empirical support for both AUClogd and AUCord. Thus, we believe theoretical and empirical arguments favor these methods as the preferred atheoretical indices of delay discounting.},

abstract = {Aims Physiopathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still matter of debate. Especially the role of amyloid $\beta$ and tau pathology in the development of the disease are still matter of debate. Changes in tau and amyloid $\beta$ peptide concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hypometabolic patterns at fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET scanning are considered as biomarkers of AD. The present study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between the concentrations of CSF total Tau (t-Tau), phosphorilated Tau (p-Tau) and A$\beta$1–42 amyloid peptide with 18F-FDG brain distribution in a group of patients with AD. Materials and methods We examined 131 newly diagnosed AD patients according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and 20 healthy controls. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 70 (±7) years; 57 were male and 74 were female. All patients and controls underwent a complete clinical investigation, including medical history, neurological examination, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a complete blood screening (including routine exams, thyroid hormones and a complete neuropsychological evaluation). Structural MRI was performed not earlier than 1 month before the 18F-FDG PET/CT. The following patients were excluded: those with isolated deficits and/or unmodified MMSE (=25/30) on revisit (period of follow-up: 6, 12 and 18 months); patients who had had a clinically manifest acute stroke in the last 6 months with a Hachinsky score greater than 4; and patients with radiological evidence of subcortical lesions. All AD patients were taken off cholinesterase inhibitor treatment throughout the study. We performed lumbar puncture and CSF sampling for diagnostic purposes 2 weeks (±2 days) before the PET/CT scan. The relationship between brain F-FDG uptake and CSF biomarkers was analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in Matlab R2012b using the MMSE score, sex and age, and other CSF biomarkers as covariates. Results t-Tau, p-Tau and A$\beta$(1–42) in CSF resulted 774 ± 345 pg/ml, 98 ± 64 pg/ml and 348.8 ± 111 pg/ml respectively. SPM analysis showed a significant negative correlation between CSF t-Tau and 18F FDG uptake in right temporal, parietal and frontal lobe (Brodmann areas, BA, 20, 40 and 8; P fdr and few corr {\textless} 0.001, ke 19534). We did not find any significant relationships with other CSF biomarkers. Conclusions t-Tau deposition in brain is related to temporal, parietal and frontal hypometabolism in AD.},

abstract = {Study objective: Patients receiving warfarin or clopidogrel are considered at increased risk for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage after blunt head trauma. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage in these patients, however, are unknown. The objective of this study is to address these gaps in knowledge. Methods: A prospective, observational study at 2 trauma centers and 4 community hospitals enrolled emergency department (ED) patients with blunt head trauma and preinjury warfarin or clopidogrel use from April 2009 through January 2011. Patients were followed for 2 weeks. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and the cumulative incidence of delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were calculated from patients who received initial cranial computed tomography (CT) in the ED. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as traumatic intracranial hemorrhage within 2 weeks after an initially normal CT scan result and in the absence of repeated head trauma. Results: A total of 1,064 patients were enrolled (768 warfarin patients [72.2{\%}] and 296 clopidogrel patients [27.8{\%}]). There were 364 patients (34.2{\%}) from Level I or II trauma centers and 700 patients (65.8{\%}) from community hospitals. One thousand patients received a cranial CT scan in the ED. Both warfarin and clopidogrel groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, although concomitant aspirin use was more prevalent among patients receiving clopidogrel. The prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher in patients receiving clopidogrel (33/276, 12.0{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 8.4{\%} to 16.4{\%}) than patients receiving warfarin (37/724, 5.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI 3.6{\%} to 7.0{\%}), relative risk 2.31 (95{\%} CI 1.48 to 3.63). Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage was identified in 4 of 687 (0.6{\%}; 95{\%} CI 0.2{\%} to 1.5{\%}) patients receiving warfarin and 0 of 243 (0{\%}; 95{\%} CI 0{\%} to 1.5{\%}) patients receiving clopidogrel. Conclusion: Although there may be unmeasured confounders that limit intergroup comparison, patients receiving clopidogrel have a significantly higher prevalence of immediate traumatic intracranial hemorrhage compared with patients receiving warfarin. Delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage is rare and occurred only in patients receiving warfarin. Discharging patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications from the ED after a normal cranial CT scan result is reasonable, but appropriate instructions are required because delayed traumatic intracranial hemorrhage may occur.

Methods: Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) and Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS), small-fiber sensitive measures, were assessed in subjects with and without clinical neuropathy. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Twenty-two subjects had symptoms and signs of neuropathy, 19 had neither, and all were receiving ART. Median sweat volume ($\mu$L) was lower at all testing sites in those with neuropathy compared to those without (p{\textless}0.01 for all). UENS and VAS (mm) were higher in neuropathy subjects (p{\textless}0.05 for each). Lower sweat volume at all sites correlated with higher pin UENS subscore, total UENS, and VAS (p{\textless}0.05 for all). In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, CD4 + T cells, sex, and use of "d-drug" ART, QSART and UENS remained associated (p=0.003).

abstract = {Objective: To correlate different methods of measuring rates of brain atrophy from serial MRI with corresponding clinical change in normal elderly subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: One hundred sixty subjects were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry Studies. At baseline, 55 subjects were cognitively normal, 41 met criteria for MCI, and 64 met criteria for AD. Each subject underwent an MRI examination of the brain at the time of the baseline clinical assessment and then again at the time of a follow-up clinical assessment, 1 to 5 years later. The annualized changes in volume of four structures were measured from the serial MRI studies: hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, whole brain, and ventricle. Rates of change on several cognitive tests/rating scales were also assessed. Subjects who were classified as normal or MCI at baseline could either remain stable or convert to a lower-functioning group. AD subjects were dichotomized into slow vs fast progressors. Results: All four atrophy rates were greater among normal subjects who converted to MCI or AD than among those who remained stable, greater among MCI subjects who converted to AD than among those who remained stable, and greater among fast than slow AD progressors. In general, atrophy on MRI was detected more consistently than decline on specific cognitive tests/rating scales. With one exception, no differences were found among the four MRI rate measures in the strength of the correlation with clinical deterioration at different stages of the disease. Conclusions: These data support the use of rates of change from serial MRI studies in addition to standard clinical/psychometric measures as surrogate markers of disease progression in AD. Estimated sample sizes required to power a therapeutic trial in MCI were an order of magnitude less for MRI than for change measures based on cognitive tests/rating scales.},

abstract = {While resting state functional connectivity has been shown to decrease in patients with mild and/or moderate Alzheimer's disease, it is not yet known how functional connectivity changes in patients as the disease progresses. Furthermore, it has been noted that the default mode network is not as homogenous as previously assumed and several fractionations of the network have been proposed. Here, we separately investigated the modulation of 3 default mode subnetworks, as identified with group independent component analysis, by comparing Alzheimer's disease patients to healthy controls and by assessing connectivity changes over time. Our results showed decreased connectivity at baseline in patients versus controls in the posterior default mode network, and increased connectivity in the anterior and ventral default mode networks. At follow-up, functional connectivity decreased across all default mode systems in patients. Our results suggest that earlier in the disease, regions of the posterior default mode network start to disengage whereas regions within the anterior and ventral networks enhance their connectivity. However, as the disease progresses, connectivity within all systems eventually deteriorates. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate that donepezil is effective in stabilizing or slowing progressive decline in cognition, function, and behavior. Several studies reveal statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantages to initiating treatment early in the course of the disease. Benefits of donepezil treatment include behavioral stabilization and preserved independence, in addition to slowed cognitive decline. Epidemiologic studies and evidence from histopathology underlie a rationale for treating patients who are cognitively impaired but do not have dementia. Clinical trials in such patients indicate that treating patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia. Substantial evidence favors initiating treatment early in the course of dementia and reinforces the necessity to assess behavior and activities of daily living to accurately evaluate treatment response. Results of early studies of donepezil in MCI are promising and suggest directions for further research. {\textcopyright} 2005 EFNS.},

One challenge faced by those who conduct research into TBI is the lack of a verified and validated biomarker that can be used to diagnose TBI or for use as a prognostic variable which can identify those at risk for poor recovery following injury or at risk for neurodegeneration later in life. Neuroimaging continues to hold promise as a TBI biomarker but is limited by a lack of clear relationship between the neuropathology of injury/recovery and the quantitative and image based data that is obtained. Specifically lacking is the data on biochemical and biologic changes that lead to alterations in neuroimaging markers. There are multiple routes towards developing the knowledge required to more definitively link pathology to imaging but the most efficient approach is expanded leveraging of in vivo human blood, serum, and imaging biomarkers with both in vivo and ex vivo animal findings. This review describes the current use and limitations of imaging in TBI including a discussion of currently used animal injury models and the available animal imaging data and extracted markers that hold the greatest promise for helping translate alterations in imaging back to injury pathology. Further, it reviews both the human and animal TBI literature supporting current standards, identifies the remaining voids in the literature, and briefly highlights recent advances in molecular imaging.

abstract = {Brain functional connectivity (FC) network, estimated with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) technique, has emerged as a promising approach for accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the conventional FC network is essentially low-order in the sense that only the correlations among brain regions (in terms of RS-fMRI time series) are taken into account. The features derived from this type of brain network may fail to serve as an effective disease biomarker. To overcome this drawback, we propose extraction of novel high-order FC correlations that characterize how the low-order correlations between different pairs of brain regions interact with each other. Specifically, for each brain region, a sliding window approach is first performed over the entire RS-fMRI time series to generate multiple short overlapping segments. For each segment, a low-order FC network is constructed, measuring the short-term correlation between brain regions. These low-order networks (obtained from all segments) describe the dynamics of short-term FC along the time, thus also forming the correlation time series for every pair of brain regions. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we further group the correlation time series into a small number of different clusters according to their intrinsic common patterns. Then, the correlation between the respective mean correlation time series of different clusters is calculated to represent the high-order correlation among different pairs of brain regions. Finally, we design a pattern classifier, by combining features of both low-order and high-order FC networks. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the high-order FC network on disease diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3282–3296, 2016. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (ℓ2 penalty) or scattered ({\pounds}1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of ℓ1, ℓ2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact ℓ1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), while still at the stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is important for the development of new treatments. However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.},

abstract = {Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been considered a transitional state between normal aging and dementia, characterised by memory impairment but normal general cognitive functioning. Recently other cognitive deficits have been reported. This has led to a modification of MCI criteria. Objective: To examine which neuropsychological tests most clearly distinguish MCI subjects from normal controls. Methods: 112 consecutive MCI subjects and 35 controls were included in the study. The diagnosis of MCI was based on an objective history of cognitive decline and a neuropsychiatric examination, comprising instruments STEP, I-Flex, MMSE, and CDR. Participants were examined with 21 neuropsychological tests in the cognitive domains speed/attention, memory and learning, visuospatial function, language, and executive function. Results: Controls were significantly older. No differences were found in education or general intellectual capacity. Controls performed significantly better than MCI on tests within all five cognitive domains. The clearest differences were seen on language tests, followed by executive function, and learning and memory. Only two subjects (1.8{\%}) were purely amnestic; 17{\%} showed no impairment compared with controls, with a cut off of 1.5 SD below age mean. These subjects were better educated and performed significantly better on measures of general cognitive capacity. Conclusions: The results illustrate the heterogeneity of MCI, with a significant degree of impairment in all five cognitive domains. When examined with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, very few subjects had an isolated memory impairment.},

abstract = {While resting state functional connectivity has been shown to decrease in patients with mild and/or moderate Alzheimer's disease, it is not yet known how functional connectivity changes in patients as the disease progresses. Furthermore, it has been noted that the default mode network is not as homogenous as previously assumed and several fractionations of the network have been proposed. Here, we separately investigated the modulation of 3 default mode subnetworks, as identified with group independent component analysis, by comparing Alzheimer's disease patients to healthy controls and by assessing connectivity changes over time. Our results showed decreased connectivity at baseline in patients versus controls in the posterior default mode network, and increased connectivity in the anterior and ventral default mode networks. At follow-up, functional connectivity decreased across all default mode systems in patients. Our results suggest that earlier in the disease, regions of the posterior default mode network start to disengage whereas regions within the anterior and ventral networks enhance their connectivity. However, as the disease progresses, connectivity within all systems eventually deteriorates. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

SBIM derivatives were prepared with 4-iodobenzene-1,2-diamine and substituted cinnamaldehydes. In binding experiments using recombinant tau and A$\beta$1-42 aggregates, SBIM-3 showed higher affinity for the tau aggregates than A$\beta$ 1-42 aggregates (ratio of Kd values was 2.73). In in vitro autoradiography and fluorescent staining, [125I]SBIM-3 (or SBIM-3) bound NFT in sections of AD brain tissue. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, all [125I]SBIM derivatives showed high initial uptake into (3.20-4.11{\%}ID/g at 2 min after the injection) and rapid clearance from (0.12-0.33{\%}ID/g at 60 min after the injection) the brain. In conclusion, appropriate structural modifications of SBIM derivatives could lead to more useful agents for the in vivo imaging of NFT in AD brains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The relationships between clinical phenotype, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) deposition and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are incompletely understood yet have important ramifications for future therapy. The goal of this study was to utilize multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) data from a clinically heterogeneous population of patients with probable AD in order to: (1) identify spatial patterns of A$\beta$ deposition measured by ( 11C)-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET) and glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET that correlate with specific clinical presentation and (2) explore associations between spatial patterns of A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism across the AD population. We included all patients meeting the criteria for probable AD (NIA-AA) who had undergone MRI, PiB and FDG-PET at our center (N = 46, mean age 63.0 ± 7.7, Mini-Mental State Examination 22.0 ± 4.8). Patients were subclassified based on their cognitive profiles into an amnestic/dysexecutive group (AD-memory; n = 27), a language-predominant group (AD-language; n = 10) and a visuospatial-predominant group (AD-visuospatial; n = 9). All patients were required to have evidence of amyloid deposition on PiB-PET. To capture the spatial distribution of A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism, we employed parallel independent component analysis (pICA), a method that enables joint analyses of multimodal imaging data. The relationships between PET components and clinical group were examined using a Receiver Operator Characteristic approach, including age, gender, education and apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 allele carrier status as covariates. Results of the first set of analyses independently examining the relationship between components from each modality and clinical group showed three significant components for FDG: a left inferior frontal and temporoparietal component associated with AD-language (area under the curve [AUC] 0.82, p = 0.011), and two components associated with AD-visuospatial (bilateral occipito-parieto-temporal [AUC 0.85, p = 0.009] and right posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]/precuneus and right lateral parietal [AUC 0.69, p = 0.045]). The AD-memory associated component included predominantly bilateral inferior frontal, cuneus and inferior temporal, and right inferior parietal hypometabolism but did not reach significance (AUC 0.65, p = 0.062). None of the PiB components correlated with clinical group. Joint analysis of PiB and FDG with pICA revealed a correlated component pair, in which increased frontal and decreased PCC/precuneus PiB correlated with decreased FDG in the frontal, occipital and temporal regions (partial r = 0.75, p {\textless} 0.0001). Using multivariate data analysis, this study reinforced the notion that clinical phenotype in AD is tightly linked to patterns of glucose hypometabolism but not amyloid deposition. These findings are strikingly similar to those of univariate paradigms and provide additional support in favor of specific involvement of the language network, higher-order visual network, and default mode network in clinical variants of AD. The inverse relationship between A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism in partially overlapping brain regions suggests that A$\beta$ may exert both local and remote effects on brain metabolism. Applying multivariate approaches such as pICA to multimodal imaging data is a promising approach for unraveling the complex relationships between different elements of AD pathophysiology. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common condition affecting children all over the world, and it represents a global public health concern. It is unclear how geopolitical, societal, and ethnic differences may influence the nature of TBI among children. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted incorporating studies with hospital-, regional-, or country-specific pediatric TBI epidemiology data published between 1995 and 2015. Incidence, age, severity, mechanism of injury, and other relevant injury characteristics were extracted and compared across diverse geographic regions. Results Thirty articles met inclusion criteria, incorporating TBI data from more than 165,000 children on 5 continents. The worldwide incidence of pediatric TBI ranges broadly and varies greatly by country, with most reporting a range between 47 and 280 per 100,000 children. After the age of 3, male children suffered higher rates of TBI than females. A bimodal age distribution is often described, with very young children (0–2 years) and adolescents (15–18) more commonly injured. Mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale ≥13) constitutes more than 80{\%} of injuries, and up to 90{\%} of all injuries are associated with negative imaging. Only a small fraction ({\textless}10{\%}) requires surgical intervention. Independent of country or region of origin, the vast majority of children suffering TBI achieve a good clinical outcome. Hospital admission rates vary widely, with U.S. patients more commonly admitted than those from other countries. Falls and motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) represent the majority of injury mechanisms. In Africa and Asia, pedestrians were most commonly injured in MVCs, while vehicle occupants were more likely involved among Australian, European, and U.S. populations. For children, nonaccidental trauma was prevalent in developing and developed nations alike. Conclusions TBI is a relatively common entity stretching across traditional geographic and demographic boundaries and affecting pediatric populations worldwide. Continued civil infrastructure development and public health policy reforms may help to reduce the societal burden of pediatric TBI.},

Recent advanced network analysis techniques utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to get more comprehensive understanding of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level. However, how to explore effective brain functional connectivity from fMRI data is still a challenge especially when the ultimate goal is to train classifiers for discriminating patients effectively. In our research, we studied the functional connectivity of the whole brain by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients based on rs-fMRI data, and proposed a set of novel features by applying Two Sample T-Test on the correlation coefficients matrix to identify the most discriminative correlation coefficients. We trained a L2-regularized Logistic Regression classifier based on the five novel features for the first time and evaluated the classification performance via leave-one-out cross validation. We also iterated 10-fold cross validation ten times in order to evaluate the statistical significance of our method. The experiment result demonstrates that classification accuracy and the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in our method are 87.5{\%} and 0.929 respectively, and the statistical results prove that our method is statistically significant better than other three algorithms, which means our method could be meaningful to assist physicians efficiently in "real-world" diagnostic situations.},

abstract = {This study was implemented to compare the value of PET, CT, and dual-modality PET/CT imaging for assessing gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) response to imatinib therapy. Methods: Twenty patients with histologically proven GIST underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging before and 1, 3, and 6 mo after the start of imatinib therapy. Separate PET and CT datasets, side-by-side PET and CT datasets, and fused PET/CT images were evaluated according to World Health Organization, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria for therapy response. Hounsfield units (HU) were assessed on CT images. A mean follow-up period of 381 ± 134 d served as the standard of reference. Results: The numbers of lesions detected in all patients were 135 with PET, 249 with CT, 279 on side-by-side evaluation, and 282 on fused PET/CT images. Tumor response was correctly characterized in 95{\%} of patients after 1 mo and 100{\%} after 3 and 6 mo with PET/CT. PET and CT images viewed side by side were correct in 90{\%} of patients at 1 mo and 100{\%} at 3 and 6 mo. PET accurately diagnosed tumor response in 85{\%} of patients at 1 mo and 100{\%} at 3 and 6 mo. CT was found to be accurate in 44{\%} of patients at 1 mo, 60{\%} at 3 mo, and 57{\%} at 6 mo. HU were found to decrease by at least 25{\%} in 12 of 14 responders after 1 mo. Conclusion: Tumor response to imatinib should be assessed with a combination of morphologic and functional imaging. Image fusion with combined PET/CT can provide additional information in individual cases when compared with side-by-side PET and CT.},

abstract = {This PET study explored the neural substrate of both dual-task management and integration task using single tasks that are known not to evoke any prefrontal activation. The paradigm included two simple (visual and auditory) discrimination tasks, a dual task and an integration task (requiring simultaneous visual and auditory discrimination), and baseline tasks (passive viewing and hearing). Data were analyzed using SPM99. As predicted, the comparison of each single task to the baseline task showed no activity in prefrontal areas. The comparison of the dual task to the single tasks demonstrated left-sided foci of activity in the frontal gyrus (BA 9/46, BA 10/47 and BA 6), inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40), and cerebellum. By reference to previous neuroimaging studies, BA 9/46 was associated with the coordinated manipulation of simultaneously presented information, BA 10/47 with selection processes, BA 6 with articulatory rehearsal, and BA 40 with attentional shifting. Globally similar regions were found for the integration task, except that the inferior parietal gyrus was not recruited. These results confirm the hypothesis that the left prefrontal cortex is implicated in dual-task performance.

abstract = {Background: Results of previous studies have shown associations between PET imaging of amyloid plaques and amyloid-$\beta$ pathology measured at autopsy. However, these studies were small and not designed to prospectively measure sensitivity or specificity of amyloid PET imaging against a reference standard. We therefore prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET imaging with neuropathology at autopsy. Methods: This study was an extension of our previous imaging-to-autopsy study of participants recruited at 22 centres in the USA who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months at enrolment. Participants had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging with florbetapir (18F). For one of the primary analyses, the interpretation of the florbetapir scans (majority interpretation of five nuclear medicine physicians, who classified each scan as amyloid positive or amyloid negative) was compared with amyloid pathology (assessed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease standards, and classed as amyloid positive for moderate or frequent plaques or amyloid negative for no or sparse plaques); correlation of the image analysis results with amyloid burden was tested as a coprimary endpoint. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were also done in the subset of participants who had autopsy within 1 year of imaging as secondary endpoints. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01447719 (original study NCT 00857415). Findings: We included 59 participants (aged 47-103 years; cognitive status ranging from normal to advanced dementia). The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir PET imaging for detection of moderate to frequent plaques were 92{\%} (36 of 39; 95{\%} CI 78-98) and 100{\%} (20 of 20; 80-100{\%}), respectively, in people who had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging, and 96{\%} (27 of 28; 80-100{\%}) and 100{\%} (18 of 18; 78-100{\%}), respectively, for those who had autopsy within 1 year. Amyloid assessed semiquantitatively with florbetapir PET was correlated with the post-mortem amyloid burden in the participants who had an autopsy within 2 years (Spearman $\rho$=0{\textperiodcentered}76; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and within 12 months between imaging and autopsy (0{\textperiodcentered}79; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: The results of this study validate the binary visual reading method approved in the USA for clinical use with florbetapir and suggest that florbetapir could be used to distinguish individuals with no or sparse amyloid plaques from those with moderate to frequent plaques. Additional research is needed to understand the prognostic implications of moderate to frequent plaque density. Funding: Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Imaging has played a variety of roles in the study of Alzheimer disease (AD) over the past four decades. Initially, computed tomography (CT) and then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used diagnostically to rule out other causes of dementia. More recently, a variety of imaging modalities including structural and functional MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) studies of cerebral metabolism with fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and amyloid tracers such as Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) have shown characteristic changes in the brains of patients with AD, and in prodromal and even presymptomatic states that can help rule-in the AD pathophysiological process. No one imaging modality can serve all purposes as each have unique strengths and weaknesses. These modalities and their particular utilities are discussed in this article. The challenge for the future will be to combine imaging biomarkers to most efficiently facilitate diagnosis, disease staging, and, most importantly, development of effective disease-modifying therapies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

The incontrol fraction nonconforming is unknown in most actual processes; therefore, it should be estimated using the Phase I sample.

The simulation results show that the adjustment with the bootstrap algorithm improves the in-control performance of geometric charts by controlling the probability that the in-control average run length has a value greater than the desired one. The out-of-control performance of geometric charts with adjusted limits is also discussed.},

abstract = {Recent neuroimaging studies have lead to the proposal that rest is characterized by an organized, baseline level of activity, a default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-oriented mental activity. Previous studies have shown that the primary function subserved by the default mode is that of an introspectively oriented, self-referential mode of mental activity. The default mode of brain function hypothesis is readdressed from the perspective of the presence of low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal changes (0.012-0.1 Hz) in the resting brain. The results show that the brain during rest is not tonically active in a single mode of brain function. Rather, the findings presented here suggest that the brain recurrently toggles between an introspectively oriented mode (default mode) and a state-of-mind that tentatively might be interpreted as an extrospectively oriented mode that involves a readiness and alertness to changes in the external and internal environment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We (1) examined regional variation of average tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in a young normal population (30–49 years) and corrected for the regional variability and (2) tested if the standardized values (z-scores) scaled appropriately to capture regional Alzheimer-specific (i.e., amyloid sensitive) tau-PET changes in individuals aged 50+ years. Methods We identified 490 individuals (70 between 30–49 years as a reference group and 420 cognitively normal between 50–95 years of age) with tau-PET and amyloid PET scans from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Results There was intrinsic regional variability in average tau-PET SUVR with uptakes higher in some regions than others, even in the younger individuals who would have minimal or no neurofibrillary tangles. We corrected for this using region of interest–specific z-scores based on the reference group. Amyloid and tau-PET uptake were associated throughout the brain after adjusting for age, with the highest correlations in the medial temporal regions. Discussion Regions with high-average SUVR are not necessarily those with the greatest tau pathology. Standardization is therefore recommended. Standardization of the data “realigns” the data such that the regional tau z-scores are informative of the disease process, that is, regions with high z-scores now coincide with regions correlated with amyloid deposition. Medial temporal structures, specifically entorhinal cortex–tau, may be useful as an AD-specific tau-PET signature due to its sensitivity to amyloid.},

abstract = {In ridge regression and related shrinkage methods, the ridge trace plot, a plot of estimated coefficients against a shrinkage parameter, is a common graphical adjunct to help determine a favorable trade-off of bias against precision (inverse variance) of the estimates. However, standard unidimensional versions of this plot are ill-suited for this purpose because they show only bias directly and ignore the multidimensional nature of the problem. A generalized version of the ridge trace plot is introduced, showing covariance ellipsoids in parameter space, whose centers show bias and whose size and shape show variance and covariance, respectively, in relation to the criteria for which these methods were developed. These provide a direct visualization of both bias and precision. Even two-dimensional bivariate versions of this plot show interesting features not revealed in the standard univariate version. Low-rank versions of this plot, based on an orthogonal transformation of predictor space extend these ideas to larger numbers of predictor variables, by focusing on the dimensions in the space of predictors that are likely to be most informative about the nature of bias and precision. Two well-known datasets are used to illustrate these graphical methods.

abstract = {Objective: The desirable property of tools used to investigate biological data is easy to understand models and predictive decisions. Decision trees are particularly promising in this regard due to their comprehensible nature that resembles the hierarchical process of human decision making. However, existing algorithms for learning decision trees have tendency to underfit gene expression data. The main aim of this work is to improve the performance and stability of decision trees with only a small increase in their complexity. Methods: We propose a multi-test decision tree (MTDT); our main contribution is the application of several univariate tests in each non-terminal node of the decision tree. We also search for alternative, lower-ranked features in order to obtain more stable and reliable predictions. Results: Experimental validation was performed on several real-life gene expression datasets. Comparison results with eight classifiers show that MTDT has a statistically significantly higher accuracy than popular decision tree classifiers, and it was highly competitive with ensemble learning algorithms. The proposed solution managed to outperform its baseline algorithm on 14 datasets by an average 6{\%}. A study performed on one of the datasets showed that the discovered genes used in the MTDT classification model are supported by biological evidence in the literature. Conclusion: This paper introduces a new type of decision tree which is more suitable for solving biological problems. MTDTs are relatively easy to analyze and much more powerful in modeling high dimensional microarray data than their popular counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Most studies of resting-state functional connectivity using fMRI employ methods that assume temporal stationarity, such as correlation and data-driven decompositions computed across the duration of the scan. However, evidence from both task-based fMRI studies and animal electrophysiology suggests that functional connectivity may exhibit dynamic changes within time scales of seconds to minutes. In the present study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of resting-state connectivity across the course of a single scan, performing a time-frequency coherence analysis based on the wavelet transform. We focused on the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a primary node of the default-mode network, examining its relationship with both the "anticorrelated" ("task-positive") network as well as other nodes of the default-mode network. It was observed that coherence and phase between the PCC and the anticorrelated network was variable in time and frequency, and statistical testing based on Monte Carlo simulations revealed the presence of significant scale-dependent temporal variability. In addition, a sliding-window correlation procedure identified other regions across the brain that exhibited variable connectivity with the PCC across the scan, which included areas previously implicated in attention and salience processing. Although it is unclear whether the observed coherence and phase variability can be attributed to residual noise or modulation of cognitive state, the present results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static, and it may therefore prove valuable to consider measures of variability, in addition to average quantities, when characterizing resting-state networks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Predicting outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury is critically important for making sound clinical decisions. This study aimed at determining the prognostic value of the Rotterdam scoring system to predict early death among these patients. Materials and Methods This study was performed prospectively on 150 patients with traumatic brain injury hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, mechanism of trauma, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and accompanying lesions were documented. A brain computed tomography was performed for each patient and scored by use of the Rotterdam system. Patients were monitored for 2 weeks after hospital discharge, and their outcomes were documented. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis and prognostic values of Rotterdam system were conducted by SPSS software. Results Nineteen patients (12.7{\%}) died during the course of the study. The mean age of the dead patients was significantly greater than those who survived (P = 0.037). The sensitivity and the specificity of the Rotterdam scoring system at the cutoff score of 4 were 84.2{\%} and 96.2{\%}, respectively. Rotterdam score was significantly correlated with patient outcomes (P {\textless} 0.0001). Moreover, logistic regression analyses revealed that factors such as age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Rotterdam score significantly contributed to patient outcomes. Conclusions Rotterdam score is an independent factor for predicting outcomes among patients with traumatic brain injury. At the cutoff score of 4, the Rotterdam system can predict outcomes among patients suffering from traumatic brain injury with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract = {The current trend in genome-wide association studies is to identify regions where the true disease-causing genes may lie by evaluating thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome. However, many challenges exist in detecting disease-causing genes among the thousands of SNPs. Examples include multicollinearity and multiple testing issues, especially when a large number of correlated SNPs are simultaneously tested. Multicollinearity can often occur when predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, and can cause imprecise estimation of association. In this study, we propose a simple stepwise procedure that identifies disease-causing SNPs simultaneously by employing elastic-net regularization, a variable selection method that allows one to address multicollinearity. At Step 1, the single-marker association analysis was conducted to screen SNPs. At Step 2, the multiple-marker association was scanned based on the elastic-net regularization. The proposed approach was applied to the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) case-control data set of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16. While the selected SNPs at the screening step are located mostly on chromosome 6, the elastic-net approach identified putative RA-related SNPs on other chromosomes in an increased proportion. For some of those putative RA-related SNPs, we identified the interactions with sex, a well known factor affecting RA susceptibility.},

abstract = {There has been substantial recent work on methods for estimating the slope function in linear regression for functional data analysis. However, as in the case of more conventional finite-dimensional regression, much of the practical interest in the slope centers on its application for the purpose of prediction, rather than on its significance in its own right. We show that the problems of slope-function estimation, and of prediction from an estimator of the slope function, have very different characteristics. While the former is intrinsically nonparametric, the latter can be either nonparametric or semi-parametric. In particular, the optimal mean-square convergence rate of predictors is n -1, where n denotes sample size, if the predictand is a sufficiently smooth function. In other cases, convergence occurs at a polynomial rate that is strictly slower than n-1. At the boundary between these two regimes, the mean-square convergence rate is less than n-1 by only a logarithmic factor. More generally, the rate of convergence of the predicted value of the mean response in the regression model, given a particular value of the explanatory variable, is determined by a subtle interaction among the smoothness of the predictand, of the slope function in the model, and of the autocovariance function for the distribution of explanatory variables. {\textcopyright} Instituts of Mathematical Statistics, 2006.},

abstract = {We propose a fused lasso logistic regression to analyze callosal thickness profiles. The fused lasso regression imposes penalties on both the l1-norm of the model coefficients and their successive differences, and finds only a small number of non-zero coefficients which are locally constant. An iterative method of solving logistic regression with fused lasso regularization is proposed to make this a practical procedure. In this study we analyzed callosal thickness profiles sampled at 100 equal intervals between the rostrum and the splenium. The method was applied to corpora callosa of elderly normal controls (NCs) and patients with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We found specific locations in the genu and splenium of AD patients that are proportionally thinner than those of NCs. Callosal thickness in these regions combined with the Mini Mental State Examination scores differentiated AD from NC with 84{\%} accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the past decade, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph-based measures have been widely used to quantitatively characterize the architectures of brain functional networks in healthy individuals and in patients with abnormalities related to psychopathic and neurological disorders. To accurately evaluate the topological organization of brain functional networks, the definition of the nodes and edges for the construction of functional networks is critical. Furthermore, both types of brain functional networks (binarized networks and weighted networks) are widely used to analyze topological organization. However, how to best select the network type is still debated. Consequently, we investigated the test-retest reliability of brain functional networks with binarized and weighted edges using two independent datasets and four strategies for defining nodes. We revealed fair to good reliability for a majority of network topological attributes and overall higher reliabilities for weighted networks than for binarized networks. For regional nodal efficiency, weighted networks also showed higher reliability across nodes. Thus, our findings imply that weighted networks contain more information, leading to more stable results. In addition, we found that the reliability of brain functional networks was influenced by the node definition strategy and that more precise of nodal definition were associated with higher reliability. The time effect of reliability was restricted, as no differences between long-term and short-term reliability were observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that weighted networks have better reliability because they reflect more topological information, implying broader applications of weighted networks related to normal and disordered function of the human brain.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of small-world and scale-free networks the study of complex systems from a network perspective has taken an enormous flight. In recent years many important properties of complex networks have been delineated. In particular, significant progress has been made in understanding the relationship between the structural properties of networks and the nature of dynamics taking place on these networks. For instance, the 'synchronizability' of complex networks of coupled oscillators can be determined by graph spectral analysis. These developments in the theory of complex networks have inspired new applications in the field of neuroscience. Graph analysis has been used in the study of models of neural networks, anatomical connectivity, and functional connectivity based upon fMRI, EEG and MEG. These studies suggest that the human brain can be modelled as a complex network, and may have a small-world structure both at the level of anatomical as well as functional connectivity. This small-world structure is hypothesized to reflect an optimal situation associated with rapid synchronization and information transfer, minimal wiring costs, as well as a balance between local processing and global integration. The topological structure of functional networks is probably restrained by genetic and anatomical factors, but can be modified during tasks. There is also increasing evidence that various types of brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, brain tumours and epilepsy may be associated with deviations of the functional network topology from the optimal small-world pattern. {\textcopyright} 2007 Stam and Reijneveld; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was proposed as a nosological entity referring to elderly people with mild cognitive deficit but no dementia. MCI is a heterogeneous clinical entity with multiple sources of heterogeneity. The concept of MCI was reviewed and a diagnostic procedure with three different stages was proposed by the European Consortium on Alzheimer's Disease Working Group on MCI. Firstly, MCI should correspond to cognitive complaints coming from the patients or their families; the reporting of a relative decline in cognitive functioning during the past year by a patient or informant; cognitive disorders as evidenced by clinical evaluation; absence of major repercussions on daily life; and absence of dementia. These criteria, similar to those defined during an international workshop in Stockholm, make it possible to identify an MCI syndrome, which is the first stage of the diagnostic procedure. Secondly, subtypes of MCI had to be recognised. Finally, the aetiopathogenic subtype could be identified. Identifying patients at a high risk for progression to dementia and establishing more specific and adapted therapeutic strategies at an early stage, together with more structured overall management, is made possible by the diagnostic procedure proposed.},

abstract = {Perceiving speech while performing another task is a common challenge in everyday life. How the brain controls resource allocation during speech perception remains poorly understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the effect of cognitive load on speech perception by examining brain responses of participants performing a phoneme discrimination task and a visual working memory task simultaneously. The visual task involved holding either a single meaningless image in working memory (low cognitive load) or four different images (high cognitive load). Performing the speech task under high load, compared to low load, resulted in decreased activity in pSTG/pMTG and increased activity in visual occipital cortex and two regions known to contribute to visual attention regulation—the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the paracingulate and anterior cingulate gyrus (PaCG, ACG). Critically, activity in PaCG/ACG was correlated with performance in the visual task and with activity in pSTG/pMTG: Increased activity in PaCG/ACG was observed for individuals with poorer visual performance and with decreased activity in pSTG/pMTG. Moreover, activity in a pSTG/pMTG seed region showed psychophysiological interactions with areas of the PaCG/ACG, with stronger interaction in the high-load than the low-load condition. These findings show that the acoustic analysis of speech is affected by the demands of a concurrent visual task and that the PaCG/ACG plays a role in allocating cognitive resources to concurrent auditory and visual information.},

abstract = {Functional brain networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been widely used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Typically, these networks are constructed by calculating functional connectivity (FC) between any pair of brain regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., using Pearson's correlation between rs-fMRI time series. However, this can only be called as a low-order representation of the functional interaction, because the relationship is investigated just between two ROIs. Brain disorders might not only affect low-order FC, but also high-order FC, i.e., the higher-level relationship among multiple brain regions, which might be more crucial for diagnosis. To comprehensively characterize such relationship for better diagnosis of ASD, we propose a multi-level, high-order FC network representation that can nicely capture complex interactions among brain regions. Then, we design a feature selection method to identify those discriminative multi-level, high-order FC features for ASD diagnosis. Finally, we design an ensemble classifier with multiple linear SVMs, each trained on a specific level of FC networks, for boosting the final classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the integration of both low-order and first-level high-order FC networks achieves the best ASD diagnostic accuracy (81{\%}). We further investigated those selected discriminative low-order and high-order FC features and found that the high-order FC features can provide complementary information to the low-order FC features in the ASD diagnosis.},

abstract = {Some forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are the clinical precursors of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while other MCI types tend to remain stable over-time and do not progress to AD. To identify and choose effective and personalized strategies to prevent or slow the progression of AD, we need to develop objective measures that are able to discriminate the MCI patients who are at risk of AD from those MCI patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are the following: 1) our deep learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD vs. healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which significantly limits data-overfitting (we use ∼550,000 network parameters, which is orders of magnitude lower than other network designs); 3) both structural MRI images and their warp field characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in relation to the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192 AD patients, n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who convert to AD and MCI patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184 healthy controls). The most predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast, the warp field metrics were of little added predictive value. The algorithm was able to distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within 3 years from those patients with stable MCI over the same time-period with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 and a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86{\%}, a sensitivity of 87.5{\%}, and specificity of 85{\%}. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100{\%} accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying patients with AD from healthy controls. Our classification framework was also robust to the use of different co-registration templates and potentially irrelevant features/image portions. Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of several medical conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders via multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.},

Virus attachment, entry, and membrane fusion are orchestrated by the envelope (E) and pre-membrane (prM) proteins, the two structural proteins displayed on the surface of virions. Flaviviruses assemble as an immature non-infectious form onto which prM and E form trimeric spikes. During egress from infected cells, flaviviruses undergo dramatic structural changes characterized by the formation of a herringbone arrangement of E proteins that lie flat against the surface of the virion and cleavage of the prM protein by the cellular protease furin. The result is a relatively smooth, infectious mature virion. This dynamic process is now understood in structural detail at the atomic level. However, recent studies indicate that many of the virions released from cells share structural features of both immature and mature virus particles. These mosaic partially mature virions are infectious and interact uniquely with target cells and the host immune response. Here, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the biology and significance of partially mature flaviviruses.},

We optimized a TBM-based image analysis method to determine what methodological factors, and which image-derived measures, maximize statistical power to track brain change. 3D maps, tracking rates of structural atrophy over time, were created from 1030 longitudinal brain MRI scans (1-year follow-up) of 104 AD patients (age: 75.7 ± 7.2 years; MMSE: 23.3 ± 1.8, at baseline), 254 amnestic MCI subjects (75.0 ± 7.2 years; 27.0 ± 1.8), and 157 healthy elderly subjects (75.9 ± 5.1 years; 29.1 ± 1.0), as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To determine which TBM designs gave greatest statistical power, we compared different linear and nonlinear registration parameters (including different regularization functions), and different numerical summary measures derived from the maps. Detection power was greatly enhanced by summarizing changes in a statistically-defined region-of-interest (ROI) derived from an independent training sample of 22 AD patients. Effect sizes were compared using cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots and false discovery rate methods. In power analyses, the best method required only 48 AD and 88 MCI subjects to give 80{\%} power to detect a 25{\%} reduction in the mean annual change using a two-sided test (at $\alpha$ = 0.05). This is a drastic sample size reduction relative to using clinical scores as outcome measures (619 AD/6797 MCI for the ADAS-Cog, and 408 AD/796 MCI for the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores).

abstract = {For 100 years, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have been recognized as the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their presence or absence could only be assessed postmortem using stains and dyes that identified these microscopic structures. Approximately 10 years ago, the first successful A$\beta$ plaque-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study was conducted in a living human subject clinically diagnosed with probable AD using the 11C-labeled radiopharmaceutical Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB). Laboratory studies and preclinical evaluations to design PiB began a decade earlier than the first human PiB PET study and involved chemical modifications of different well-known dyes that bound specifically to the extended $\beta$-pleated sheets that comprise the fibrils of amyloid proteins such as A$\beta$ plaques, NFTs, $\beta$-synuclein deposits, and prions. These preclinical studies were conducted in our laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh, starting with Congo red derivatives, followed by Chrysamine G derivatives, followed by X-series compounds, and finally with neutral derivatives of thioflavin-T. The in vitro and in vivo evaluations of the different derivatives as candidate PET radioligands for imaging A$\beta$ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in human brain are described in this review, along with the specific evaluation criteria by which the candidate radioligands were judged. Out of these studies came PiB, a PET radioligand that binds selectively and with high affinity to only fibrillar forms of A$\beta$. PiB has been used in many different human research protocols throughout the world and has demonstrated the usefulness of assessing the A$\beta$ plaque status of subjects many years before the clinical diagnosis of probable AD. Recently, longer-lived 18F-radiolabeled A$\beta$-selective radiopharmaceuticals have been developed. It is likely that the full clinical impact of these imaging agents will be realized by identifying presymptomatic subjects who would benefit from early drug treatments with future disease-modifying AD therapeutics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In $\epsilon$4 carriers from neuropathologically verified discovery, neuropathologically verified replication, and clinically characterized replication cohorts of 1411 cases and controls, LOAD was associated with six SNPs from the GRB-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) gene and a common haplotype encompassing the entire GAB2 gene.

abstract = {Dementia is a complex human disease. The incidence of dementia among the elderly population is rising rapidly worldwide. In the United States, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading type of dementia and was the fifth and eighth leading cause of death in women and men aged ≥ 65 years, respectively, in 2003. In Taiwan and many other counties, dementia is a hidden health issue because of its underestimation in the elderly population. In Western countries, the prevalence of AD increases from 1-3{\%} among people aged 60-64 years to 35{\%} among those aged {\textgreater} 85 years. In Taiwan, the prevalence of dementia for people aged ≥ 65 years was 2-4{\%} by 2000. Therefore, it is important to identify protective and risk factors for dementia to prevent this disease at an early stage. Several factors are related to dementia, e.g. age, ethnicity, sex, genetic factors, physical activity, smoking, drug use, education level, alcohol consumption, body mass index, comorbidity, and environmental factors. In this review, we focus on studies that have evaluated the association between these factors and the risk of dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. We also suggest future research directions for researchers in dementia-related fields. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier {\&} Formosan Medical Association.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns were examined together with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in serial scans of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The SPARE-AD score, summarizing brain atrophy patterns, was tested as a predictor of short-term conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI individuals that converted to AD (MCI-C) had mostly positive baseline SPARE-AD (Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD) and atrophy in temporal lobe gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), posterior cingulate/precuneous, and insula. MCI individuals that converted to AD had mostly AD-like baseline CSF biomarkers. MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC) had mixed baseline SPARE-AD and CSF values, suggesting that some MCI-NC subjects may later convert. Those MCI-NC with most negative baseline SPARE-AD scores (normal brain structure) had significantly higher baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (28.67) than others, and relatively low annual rate of Mini Mental State Examination decrease (-0.25). MCI-NC with midlevel baseline SPARE-AD displayed faster annual rates of SPARE-AD increase (indicating progressing atrophy). SPARE-AD and CSF combination improved prediction over individual values. In summary, both SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers showed high baseline sensitivity, however, many MCI-NC had abnormal baseline SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers. Longer follow-up will elucidate the specificity of baseline measurements. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 allele, abnormal CSF A$\beta$42, Tau and phosphorylated Tau (phospho-Tau) levels are associated with elevated risk for AD. Methods: APOE genotyping was done by PCR based method and baseline CSF A$\beta$42, Tau and phospho-Tau were measured by ELISA from 60 controls and 79 MCI patients. Results: Thirty-three MCI patients developed dementia during an average of 3.5 years follow-up. CSF A$\beta$42 was decreased and Tau and phospho-Tau were increased in the progressive MCI patients. The APOE $\epsilon$4 allele was more frequent in the progressive MCI patients. The APOE $\epsilon$4 allele showed a dose dependent association to the A$\beta$42 levels in the progressive MCI patients and to all of the markers in controls. Conclusions: Decreased CSF A$\beta$42 and elevated Tau or phospho-Tau together with APOE $\epsilon$4 allele are highly predictive for the dementia in MCI patients with amnestic or executive symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Study objective: We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based rapid influenza testing and treatment for influenza in adult emergency department (ED) patients who are at high risk for or have evidence of influenza-related complications. Methods: We developed a cost-utility decision analysis model that assessed adult patients presenting to the ED with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for recommended antiviral treatment. Analysis was performed from the societal perspective, with incremental comparisons of 4 influenza testing and treatment strategies: treat none, treat according to provider judgment, treat according to results of a PCR-based rapid diagnostic test, and treat all. Results: Treating no patients with antivirals was dominated by all other strategies that increased in both cost and benefit in the following order: treat according to provider judgment, treat according to results of a PCR-based rapid diagnostic test, and treat all. As influenza prevalence increases, treating all patients eventually dominated all other options. Conclusion: The economic benefit of incorporating use of rapid PCR-based influenza testing for ED patients at risk of developing influenza-related complications depends on influenza prevalence; treatment guided by physician diagnosis or rapid testing, and treatment of all patients is more effective and less costly than no treatment. {\textcopyright} 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

abstract = {Conventional N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is a heteromeric complex between the essential NR1 subunit and one of NR2A-D subunits toward functional channels permeable to Ca 2+ rather than Na + ions. Although recent studies identified dominant negative NR3A and NR3B subunits, whether these subunits inhibit Ca 2+ mobilization through NMDAR channels into mitochondria is not clarified so far. In this study, we investigated Ca 2+ influx across acquired NMDAR channels composed of different NR subunits artificially expressed in HEK293 cells. The addition of NMDA markedly increased intracellular free Ca 2+ levels determined by Fluo-3 in cells transfected with either NR2A or NR2B subunit together with NR1 subunit. Further addition of dizocilpine completely inhibited the increase by NMDA in both types of acquired channels, while the NR2B subunit selective antagonist ifenprodil drastically inhibited the increase by NMDA in cells expressing NR1/NR2B, but not NR1/NR2A, subunits. Similar pharmacological profiles were invariably seen with cell death by NMDA. Introduction of both NR3A and NR3B subunits significantly inhibited the increase by NMDA in intracellular free Ca 2+ levels in both acquired channels, while introduction of either NR3A or NR3B alone was ineffective. Co-expression of both NR3A and NR3B subunits was also required for the prevention of increased mitochondrial free Ca 2+ levels determined by Rhod-2, as well as decreased cellular viability, in cells expressing NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B subunits upon exposure to NMDA. These results suggest that co-expression of both NR3A and NR3B subunits is essential for the dominant negative properties on Ca 2+ mobilization through acquired functional NMDAR channels into mitochondria. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The interrelationships between pathological processes and emerging clinical phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are important yet complicated to study, because the brain is a complex network where local disruptions can have widespread effects. Recently, properties in brain networks obtained with neuroimaging techniques have been studied in AD with tools from graph theory. However, the interpretation of graph alterations remains unclear, because the definition of connectivity depends on the imaging modality used. Here we examined which graph properties have been consistently reported to be disturbed in AD studies, using a heuristically defined " graph space" to investigate which theoretical models can best explain graph alterations in AD. Findings from structural and functional graphs point to a loss of highly connected areas in AD. However, studies showed considerable variability in reported group differences of most graph properties. This suggests that brain graphs might not be isometric, which complicates the interpretation of graph measurements. We highlight confounding factors such as differences in graph construction methods and provide recommendations for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Individuals with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) have a risk of developing a psychotic disorder significantly greater than the general population. However, it is not currently possible to predict which ARMS individuals will develop psychosis from clinical assessment alone. Comparison of ARMS subjects who do, and do not, develop psychosis can reveal which factors are critical for the onset of illness. In the present study, 37 patients with an ARMS were followed clinically at least 24 months subsequent to initial referral. Functional MRI data were collected at the beginning of the follow-up period during performance of an executive task known to recruit frontal lobe networks and to be impaired in psychosis. Graph theoretical analysis was used to compare the organization of a functional brain network in ARMS patients who developed a psychotic disorder following the scan (ARMS-T) to those who did not become ill during the same follow-up period (ARMS-NT) and aged-matched controls. The global properties of each group's representative network were studied (density, efficiency, global average path length) as well as regionally-specific contributions of network nodes to the organization of the system (degree, farness-centrality, betweenness-centrality). We focused our analysis on the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region known to support executive function that is structurally and functionally impaired in ARMS patients. In the absence of between-group differences in global network organization, we report a significant reduction in the topological centrality of the ACC in the ARMS-T group relative to both ARMS-NT and controls. These results provide evidence that abnormalities in the functional organization of the brain predate the onset of psychosis, and suggest that loss of ACC topological centrality is a potential biomarker for transition to psychosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of kynurenic acid (KYNA) had sedative and hypnotic effects during stress in neonatal chicks. However, its mechanism has not been clarified. KYNA is an endogenous antagonist of the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine ($\alpha$7nACh) receptor and N-methyl-. d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Therefore, this study clarified the mechanism of sedative and hypnotic effects of KYNA in the brain during an acute stress. In Experiment 1, to investigate the relationship between KYNA and the $\alpha$7nACh receptor, KYNA was injected i.c.v. with galantamine, an agonist of the allosteric potentiating site of the $\alpha$7nACh receptor. Galantamine did not attenuate the effect of KYNA, but higher levels of galantamine caused harmful effects. In Experiment 2, the role of the NMDA receptor was investigated using the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-MK-801, d-serine which has high affinity to a co-agonist glycine site at the NMDA receptors, NMDA as the NMDA receptor agonist, and 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (QUIN), an agonist of the NMDA receptor subgroup containing the subunits NR2A and NR2B. The behavioral changes following KYNA were partially attenuated by QUIN alone. In conclusion, we suggest that KYNA functioned via the simultaneous inhibition of the $\alpha$7nACh receptor and NMDA receptor subgroup containing the subunits NR2A and NR2B. {\textcopyright} 2013 IBRO.},

Eighteen MCI converts (average age 73.6 years; 11 male) and 62 age-matched MCI non-converters (average age 73.0 years, 28 male) were included in this study. We trained and tested a support vector machine (SVM) to classify MCI-C from MCI-NC using features constructed based on the local and global graph measures. A novel feature selection algorithm was developed and utilized to select an optimal subset of features. Results Using subset of optimal features in SVM, we classified MCI-C from MCI-NC with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 91.4{\%}, 83.24{\%}, 90.1{\%}, and 0.95, respectively.

abstract = {Elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) is a flexible regularization and vari-able selection method that uses a mixture of L2 and L2 penalties. It is particularly useful when there are much more predictors than the sample size. This paper pro-poses a Bayesian method to solve the elastic net model using a Gibbs sampler. While the marginal posterior mode of the regression coeffcients is equivalent to estimates given by the non-Bayesian elastic net, the Bayesian elastic net has two major advantages. Firstly, as a Bayesian method, the distributional results on the estimates are straightforward, making the statistical inference easier. Secondly, it chooses the two penalty parameters simultaneously, avoiding the "double shrinkage problem" in the elastic net method. Real data examples and simulation studies show that the Bayesian elastic net behaves comparably in prediction accuracy but performs better in variable selection. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

abstract = {Acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) are drugs frequently prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), exerting an effect on cognition, as well as on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and activities of daily living. The efficacy of AChEI may be ascribed not only to the activation of cholinergic transmission, but also to other mechanisms, among which a putative regulation of the immune response has already been hypothesized. In the present study, we evaluated, in a cross-sectional sample of 66. AD patients and 48 healthy controls, the putative influence of AChEI on anti-Abeta 1-42 antibody plasma levels by ELISA assay. AD patients receiving AChEI therapy showed increased plasma levels of anti-Abeta 1-42 antibodies respect to untreated AD patients and antibodies levels similar to those of healthy controls, both before and after normalization by total IgG values. Our results support a potential role of AChEI in the modulation of the immune response against Abeta. We suggest that a strategy aimed at increasing the endogenous response against this peptide might represent an interesting therapeutic target to be further investigated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a widely used statistic for assessing the discriminatory capacity of species distribution models. Here, I used simulated data to examine the interdependence of the AUC and classical discrimination measures (sensitivity and specificity) derived for the application of a threshold. I shall further exemplify with simulated data the implications of using the AUC to evaluate potential versus realized distribution models. Innovation After applying the threshold that makes sensitivity and specificity equal, a strong relationship between the AUC and these two measures was found. This result is corroborated with real data. On the other hand, the AUC penalizes the models that estimate potential distributions (the regions where the species could survive and reproduce due to the existence of suitable environmental conditions), and favours those that estimate realized distributions (the regions where the species actually lives). Main conclusions Firstly, the independence of the AUC from the threshold selection may be irrelevant in practice. This result also emphasizes the fact that the AUC assumes nothing about the relative costs of errors of omission and commission. However, in most real situations this premise may not be optimal. Measures derived from a contingency table for different cost ratio scenarios, together with the ROC curve, may be more informative than reporting just a single AUC value. Secondly, the AUC is only truly informative when there are true instances of absence available and the objective is the estimation of the realized distribution. When the potential distribution is the goal of the research, the AUC is not an appropriate performance measure because the weight of commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score is commonly used, although the utility regarding this score in staging dementia severity is not well established. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of CDR-SOB scores in staging dementia severity compared with the global CDR score. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium minimum data set cohort. Participants: A total of 1577 participants (110 controls, 202 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 1265 patients with probable Alzheimer disease) were available for analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated from a derivation sample to determine optimal cutoff scores and ranges, which were then applied to the validation sample. Results: Optimal ranges of CDR-SOB scores corresponding to the global CDR scores were 0.5 to 4.0 for a global score of 0.5, 4.5 to 9.0 for a global score of 1.0, 9.5 to 15.5 for a global score of 2.0, and 16.0 to 18.0 for a global score of 3.0. When applied to the validation sample, $\kappa$ scores ranged from 0.86 to 0.94 (P {\textless} .001 for all), with 93.0{\%} of the participants falling within the new staging categories. Conclusions: The CDR-SOB score compares well with the global CDR score for dementia staging. Owing to the increased range of values, the CDR-SOB score offers several advantages over the global score, including increased utility in tracking changes within and between stages of dementia severity. Interpretive guidelines for CDR-SOB scores are provided. {\textcopyright}2008 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) - $\epsilon$4 allele. In late-onset familial AD, women have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease than do men. The aim of this study was to determine whether the gender difference in familial AD is a function of APOE genotype. We studied 58 late-onset familial AD kindreds. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess genotype-specific distributions of age at onset. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression with adjustment for age and by conditional logistic regression with stratification on families. All methods detected a significant gender difference for the $\epsilon$4 heterozygous genotype. In women, $\epsilon$4 heterozygotes had higher risk than those without $\epsilon$4; there was no significant difference between $\epsilon$4 heterozygotes and $\epsilon$4 homozygotes. In men, $\epsilon$4 heterozygotes had lower risk than $\epsilon$4 homozygotes; there was no significant difference between $\epsilon$4 heterozygotes and those without $\epsilon$4. A direct comparison of $\epsilon$4 heterozygous men and women revealed a significant twofold increased risk in women. We confirmed these results in 15 autopsy-confirmed AD kindreds from the National Cell Repository at Indiana University Alzheimer Disease Center. These observations are consistent with the increased incidence of familial AD in women and may be a critical clue to the role of gender in the pathogenesis of AD. {\textcopyright} 1996 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

abstract = {Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are often used to measure the ability of survival models to predict future risk. Estimation of these parameters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are time-dependent and by the fact that censoring affects their estimation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or coefficients of survival regression models. The authors present several estimators that overcome these complications. One approach is a recursive calculation over the ordered times of events, analogous to the Kaplan-Meier approach to survival function estimation. Another is to first apply Bayes' theorem to write the parameters of interest in terms of conditional survival functions that are then estimated by survival analysis methods. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well in practical situations, when compared with an estimator (c-statistic, from logistic regression) that ignores time. An illustration with data from a cardiovascular follow-up study is provided. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

A multi-modal dictionary is usually learned from feature samples across different classes and shared in the feature encoding process.

Image features are encoded as linear combinations of selected atoms in a given dictionary. We propose to use elastic net as regularizer to select atoms in feature coding and related dictionary learning process, which not only benefits from the sparsity similar as ℓ1 penalty but also encourages a grouping effect that helps improve image representation.

However, they generate up to thousands of points per second, and handling the huge amount of point data is a major problem. It becomes quite important, therefore, to reduce the amount of acquired point data and convert it into formats required by the manufacturing processes while maintaining the accuracy.

Graph description measures may be useful as predictor variables in classification procedures. Here, we consider several centrality measures as predictor features in a classification algorithm to identify nodes of resting-state networks containing predictive information that can discriminate between typical developing children and patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prediction was based on a support vector machines classifier. The analyses were performed in a multisite and publicly available resting-state fMRI dataset of healthy children and ADHD patients: the ADHD-200 database. Network centrality measures contained little predictive information for the discrimination between ADHD patients and healthy subjects. However, the classification between inattentive and combined ADHD subtypes was more promising, achieving accuracies higher than 65{\%} (balance between sensitivity and specificity) in some sites. Finally, brain regions were ranked according to the amount of discriminant information and the most relevant were mapped. As hypothesized, we found that brain regions in motor, frontoparietal, and default mode networks contained the most predictive information. We concluded that the functional connectivity estimations are strongly dependent on the sample characteristics. Thus different acquisition protocols and clinical heterogeneity decrease the predictive values of the graph descriptors.},

Methods: We searched 6 electronic databases for cohort studies published from January 1966 to March 2015. Eligible studies were required to be relevant to the subject and provide sufficient data for our needs. Results: 60 cohort studies with 14 821 participants from 16 countries were included in the meta-analysis. The strongest positive associations between risk factors and the progression from MCI to AD were found for abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), phosphorylated $\pi$ (p-$\pi$) (relative risk (RR)=2.43, 95{\%} CI=1.70 to 3.48), abnormal CSF $\pi$/A$\beta$1-42 (RR=3.77, 95{\%} CI=2.34 to 6.09), hippocampal atrophy (RR=2.59, 95{\%} CI=1.95 to 3.44), medial temporal lobe atrophy (RR=2.11, 95{\%} CI=1.70 to 2.63) and entorhinal atrophy (RR=2.03, 95{\%} CI=1.57 to 2.62).

We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using flurodeoxyglucose and florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2{\%}) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p {\textless} 0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p {\textless} 0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep learning as a practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways. There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing. Results: We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than the competing approaches. Availability and Implementation: The methods are implemented in R package FUNNEL, freely and publicly available at: Https://github.com/yunzhang813/FUNNEL-GSEA-R-Package.},

We focused on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia because these stages often go undetected, and their detection is important for treatment. Using standardized diagnostic criteria combined with history, physical examination, and cognitive, laboratory, and neuroimaging studies, we staged 471 community-dwelling subjects for dementia severity by using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. We then used correspondence analysis (CA) to derive a weighted score for each subject from their item responses over the three immediate- and one delayed-recall trials of the CWL. These CA-weighted scores were used with logistic regression to predict each subject's probability of impairment, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to measure accuracy. For MCI vs. normal, accuracy was 97{\%} [confidence interval (C.I.) 97-98{\%}], sensitivity was 94{\%} (C.I. 93-95{\%}), and specificity was 89{\%} (C.I. 88-91{\%}). For MCI/mild dementia vs. normal, accuracy was 98{\%} (C.I. 98-99{\%}), sensitivity was 96{\%} (C.I. 95-97{\%}), and specificity was 91{\%} (C.I. 89-93{\%}). MCI sensitivity was 12{\%} higher (without lowering specificity) than that obtained with the delayed-recall total score (the standard method for CWL interpretation). Optimal positive and negative predictive values were 100{\%} and at least 96.6{\%}. These results show that CA-weighted scores can significantly improve early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a widespread cause of neurologic disability, with {\textgreater} 70{\%} of cases being mild in severity. Magnetic resonance imaging provides objective biomarkers in the diagnosis of brain injury by detecting brain lesions resulting from trauma. This paper reports on the detection rates of presumed trauma-related pathology using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in TBI patients with chronic, persistent symptoms. Methods: 180 subjects with persistent neurobehavioral symptoms following head trauma referred by personal injury attorneys and 94 asymptomatic, age-matched volunteers were included in the study. 83{\%} of TBI subjects were classified as mild. Results: TBI subjects had a significantly greater number of lesions detected by FLAIR than controls (42{\%} vs. 22{\%}) and more lesions detected by SWI than controls (28{\%} vs. 3{\%}). To reduce the confounding effects of aging, we examined mild TBI subjects {\textless} 45 years of age, which reduced the rate of lesions detected by FLAIR (26{\%} vs. 2{\%}) and SWI (15{\%} vs. 0{\%}). This younger group, which contained few age-related lesions, also demonstrated that subcortical lesions on FLAIR are more specific for TBI than deeper lesions. Conclusions: While the presence of litigation in mild TBI cases with incomplete recovery has been associated with greater expression of symptomatology and, by extension, poorer outcomes, this study shows that mild TBI patients in litigation with chronic, persistent symptoms may have associated brain injury underlying their symptoms detectable by MRI biomarkers.},

abstract = {This article describes a novel approach to extract cortical morphological abnormality patterns from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to improve the prediction accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Conventional approaches extract cortical morphological information, such as regional mean cortical thickness and regional cortical volumes, independently at different regions of interest (ROIs) without considering the relationship between these regions. Our approach involves constructing a similarity map where every element in the map represents the correlation of regional mean cortical thickness between a pair of ROIs. We will demonstrate in this article that this correlative morphological information gives significant improvement in classification performance when compared with ROI-based morphological information. Classification performance is further improved by integrating the correlative information with ROI-based information via multi-kernel support vector machines. This integrated framework achieves an accuracy of 92.35{\%} for AD classification with an area of 0.9744 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and an accuracy of 83.75{\%} for MCI classification with an area of 0.9233. In differentiating MCI subjects who converted to AD within 36 months from non-converters, an accuracy of 75.05{\%} with an area of 0.8426 under ROC curve was achieved, indicating excellent diagnostic power and generalizability. The current work provides an alternative approach to extraction of high-order cortical information from structural MRI data for prediction of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Characterizing interactions between multiple brain regions is important for understanding brain function. Functional connectivity measures based on partial correlation provide an estimate of the linear conditional dependence between brain regions after removing the linear influence of other regions. Estimation of partial correlations is, however, difficult when the number of regions is large, as is now increasingly the case with a growing number of large-scale brain connectivity studies. To address this problem, we develop novel methods for estimating sparse partial correlations between multiple regions in fMRI data using elastic net penalty (SPC-EN), which combines L1- and L2-norm regularization We show that L1-norm regularization in SPC-EN provides sparse interpretable solutions while L2-norm regularization improves the sensitivity of the method when the number of possible connections between regions is larger than the number of time points, and when pair-wise correlations between brain regions are high. An issue with regularization-based methods is choosing the regularization parameters which in turn determine the selection of connections between brain regions. To address this problem, we deploy novel stability selection methods to infer significant connections between brain regions. We also compare the performance of SPC-EN with existing methods which use only L1-norm regularization (SPC-L1) on simulated and experimental datasets. Detailed simulations show that the performance of SPC-EN, measured in terms of sensitivity and accuracy is superior to SPC-L1, especially at higher rates of feature prevalence. Application of our methods to resting-state fMRI data obtained from 22 healthy adults shows that SPC-EN reveals a modular architecture characterized by strong inter-hemispheric links, distinct ventral and dorsal stream pathways, and a major hub in the posterior medial cortex - features that were missed by conventional methods. Taken together, our findings suggest that SPC-EN provides a powerful tool for characterizing connectivity involving a large number of correlated regions that span the entire brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This long "preclinical" phase of AD would provide a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention; however, we need to further elucidate the link between the pathological cascade of AD and the emergence of clinical symptoms. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical AD, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of AD when some disease-modifying therapies may be most efficacious. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Alzheimer's Association.

The CAD system was developed in four stages. First, we used a voxel-based morphometry technique to investigate global and local gray matter (GM) atrophy in an AD group compared with healthy controls (HCs). Regions with significant GM volume reduction were segmented as volumes of interest (VOIs). Second, these VOIs were used to extract voxel values from the respective atrophy regions in AD, HC, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) patient groups. The voxel values were then extracted into a feature vector. Third, at the feature-selection stage, all features were ranked according to their respective t-test scores and a genetic algorithm designed to find the optimal feature subset. The Fisher criterion was used as part of the objective function in the genetic algorithm. Finally, the classification was carried out using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation. We evaluated the proposed automatic CAD system by applying it to baseline values from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (160 AD, 162 HC, 65 sMCI and 71 pMCI subjects). The experimental results indicated that the proposed system is capable of distinguishing between sMCI and pMCI patients, and would be appropriate for practical use in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to dementia and the associated biosignatures has recently received increasing attention in AD research. Different biosignatures for AD (neuroimaging, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures) may contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis of AD.Methods: We have conducted a comprehensive study using a large number of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the power of integrating various baseline data for predicting the conversion from MCI to probable AD and identifying a small subset of biosignatures for the prediction and assess the relative importance of different modalities in predicting MCI to AD conversion. We have employed sparse logistic regression with stability selection for the integration and selection of potential predictors. Our study differs from many of the other ones in three important respects: (1) we use a large cohort of MCI samples that are unbiased with respect to age or education status between case and controls (2) we integrate and test various types of baseline data available in ADNI including MRI, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures and (3) we apply sparse logistic regression with stability selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection.Results: We have used 319 MCI subjects from ADNI that had MRI measurements at the baseline and passed quality control, including 177 MCI Non-converters and 142 MCI Converters. Conversion was considered over the course of a 4-year follow-up period. A combination of 15 features (predictors) including those from MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and cognitive measures achieves the best prediction with an AUC score of 0.8587.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the power of integrating various baseline data for prediction of the conversion from MCI to probable AD. Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of stability selection for feature selection in the context of sparse logistic regression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Ye et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60-70{\%} of all cases [Hebert et al., 2003, 1]. The need for effective therapies for AD is great. Current approaches, including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, are symptomatic treatments for AD but do not prevent disease progression. Many diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to AD are currently changing due to the knowledge that underlying pathology starts 10 to 20. years before clinical signs of dementia appear [Holtzman et al., 2011, 2]. New therapies which focus on prevention or delay of the onset or cognitive symptoms are needed. Recent advances in the identification of AD biomarkers now make it possible to detect AD pathology in the preclinical stage of the disease, in cognitively normal (CN) individuals; this biomarker data should be used in the selection of high-risk populations for clinical trials. In vivo visualization of AD neuropathology and biological, biochemical or physiological confirmation of the effects of treatment likely will substantially improve development of novel pharmaceuticals. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the leading neuroimaging tool to detect and provide quantitative measures of AD amyloid pathology in vivo at the early stages and follow its course longitudinally.

abstract = {It is difficult to find the optimal sparse solution of a manifold learning based dimensionality reduction algorithm. The lasso or the elastic net penalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a lasso penalized least square problem and thus the least angle regression (LARS) (Efron et al., Ann Stat 32(2):407-499, 2004), one of the most popular algorithms in sparse learning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect ways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In this paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality reduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a series of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso penalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal sparse solution ofMEN. In particular,MEN has the following advantages for subsequent classification: (1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved for low dimensional data representation, (2) both the margin maximization and the classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection calculation, (3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in computation, (4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and (5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular datasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction algorithms. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Pineal melatonin is important not only for synchronization of biological rhythms, but also in the ageing process as a potential drug to relieve oxidative damage. During ageing, the nocturnal melatonin production decreases resulting in an increased incidence of disorders. Present in vivo experiments were performed to study the effects of exogenous melatonin chronically administered to old rats on the pineal biosynthesis of melatonin and the precursor serotonin (5-HT) mediated by tryptophan hydroxylase type 1 (TPH-1). Accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) after decarboxylase inhibition was used as a measure of the TPH-1 activity. 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA were also quantified by HPLC-ED. As expected, ageing resulted in worsening of different neurochemical parameters. However, chronic intake of melatonin (1. mg/kg/day, diluted in drinking water, 4. weeks) increased TPH-1 activity and significantly improved the age-induced deficits in nocturnal melatonin content in the pineal gland. Results suggest that melatonin intake (or melatonin rich foods) may contribute to recover the pineal function preventing the nocturnal descent of 5-HT and melatonin biosynthesis that normally occur in pineal gland as a consequence of ageing. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The coming century is surely the century of data. A combination of blind faith and serious purpose makes our society invest massively in the collection and processing of data of all kinds, on scales unimaginable until recently. Hyperspectral Imagery, Internet Portals, Financial tick-by-tick data, and DNA Microarrays are just a few of the better- known sources, feeding data in torrential streams into scientific and business databases worldwide. In traditional statistical data analysis, we think of observations of instances of par- ticular phenomena (e.g. instance ↔ human being), these observations being a vector of values we measured on several variables (e.g. blood pressure, weight, height, ...). In traditional statistical methodology, we assumed many observations and a few, well- chosen variables. The trend today is towards more observations but even more so, to radically larger numbers of variables – voracious, automatic, systematic collection of hyper-informative detail about each observed instance. We are seeing examples where the observations gathered on individual instances are curves, or spectra, or images, or even movies, so that a single observation has dimensions in the thousands or billions, while there are only tens or hundreds of instances available for study. Classical methods are simply not designed to cope with this kind of explosive growth of dimensionality of the observation vector. We can say with complete confidence that in the coming cen- tury, high-dimensional data analysis will be a very significant activity, and completely new methods of high-dimensional data analysis will be developed; we just don't know what they are yet. Mathematicians are ideally prepared for appreciating the abstract issues involved in finding patterns in such high-dimensional data. Two of the most influential prin- ciples in the coming century will be principles originally discovered and cultivated by mathematicians: the blessings of dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality is a phrase used by several subfields in the mathematical sciences; I use it here to refer to the apparent intractability of systematically searching through a high-dimensional space, the apparent intractability of accurately approxi- mating a general high-dimensional function, the apparent intractability of integrating a high-dimensional function. The blessings of dimensionality are less widely noted, but they include the concen- tration of measure phenomenon (so-called in the geometry of Banach spaces), which means that certain random fluctuations are very well controlled in high dimensions and the success of asymptotic methods, used widely in mathematical statistics and statistical physics, which suggest that statements about very high-dimensional settings may be made where moderate dimensions would be too complicated. There is a large body of interesting work going on in the mathematical sciences, both to attack the curse of dimensionality in specific ways, and to extend the benefits of dimensionality. I will mention work in high-dimensional approximation theory, in probability theory, and in mathematical statistics. I expect to see in the coming decades many further mathematical elaborations to our inventory of Blessings and Curses, and I expect such contributions to have a broad impact on society's ability to extract meaning from the massive datasets it has decided to compile. In my talk, I will also draw on my personal research experiences which suggest to me (1) there are substantial chances that by interpreting ongoing development in high-dimensional data analysis, mathematicians can become aware of new problems in harmonic analysis; and (2) that many of the problems of data analysis even in fairly low dimensions are unsolved and are similar to problems in mathematics which have only recently been attacked, and for which only the merest beginnings have been made. Both fields can progress together.},

abstract = {Reduction of the high dimensional binary classification data using penalized logistic regression is one of the challenges when the explanatory variables are correlated. To tackle both estimating the coefficients and performing the variable selection simultaneously, elastic net penalty was successfully applied in high dimensional binary classification. However, elastic net has two major limitations. First it does not encourage grouping effects when there is no high correlation. Second, it is not consistent in variable selection. To address these issues, an adjusted of the elastic net (AEN) and its adaptive adjusted elastic net (AAEM), are proposed to take into account the small and medium correlation between explanatory variables and to provide the consistency of the variable selection simultaneously. Our simulation and real data results show that AEN and AAEN have advantage with small, medium, and extremely correlated variables in terms of both prediction and variable selection consistency comparing with other existing penalized methods.},

abstract = {Amyloid positron-emission-tomography (PET) offers an important research and diagnostic tool for investigating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The majority of amyloid PET studies have used the cerebellum as a reference region, and clinical studies have not accounted for atrophy-based partial volume effects (PVE). Longitudinal studies using cerebellum as reference tissue have revealed only small mean increases and high inter-subject variability in amyloid binding. We aimed to test the effects of different reference regions and PVE-correction (PVEC) on the discriminatory power and longitudinal performance of amyloid PET.We analyzed [18F]-AV45 PET and T1-weighted MRI data of 962 subjects at baseline and two-year follow-up data of 258 subjects. Cortical composite volume-of-interest (VOI) values (COMP) for tracer uptake were generated using either full brain atlas VOIs, gray matter segmented VOIs or gray matter segmented VOIs after VOI-based PVEC. Standard-uptake-value ratios (SUVR) were calculated by scaling the COMP values to uptake in cerebellum (SUVRCBL), brainstem (SUVRBST) or white matter (SUVRWM). Mean SUV, SUVR, and changes after PVEC were compared at baseline between diagnostic groups of healthy controls (HC; N=316), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N=483) and AD (N=163). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were calculated for the discriminations between HC, MCI and AD, and expressed as area under the curve (AUC). Finally, the longitudinal [18F]-AV45-PET data were used to analyze the impact of quantitation procedures on apparent changes in amyloid load over time. Reference region SUV was most constant between diagnosis groups for the white matter. PVEC led to decreases of COMP-SUV in HC (-. 18{\%}) and MCI (-. 10{\%}), but increases in AD (+. 7{\%}). Highest AUCs were found when using PVEC with white matter scaling for the contrast between HC/AD (0.907) or with brainstem scaling for the contrast between HC/MCI (0.658). Longitudinal increases were greatest in all diagnosis groups with application of PVEC, and inter-subject variability was lowest for the white matter reference.Thus, discriminatory power of [18F]-AV45-PET was improved by use of a VOI-based PVEC and white matter or brainstem rather than cerebellum reference region. Detection of longitudinal amyloid increases was optimized with PVEC and white matter reference tissue.},

abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99{\%} of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

abstract = {Background: Imaging with amyloid-$\beta$ PET can potentially aid the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Florbetaben ( 18F) is a promising 18F-labelled amyloid-$\beta$-targeted PET tracer in clinical development. We aimed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of florbetaben ( 18F) PET in discriminating between patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and elderly healthy controls. Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised phase 2 study in 18 centres in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and the USA. Imaging with florbetaben ( 18F) PET was done on patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (age 55 years or older, mini-mental state examination [MMSE] score=18-26, clinical dementia rating [CDR]=0{\textperiodcentered}5-2{\textperiodcentered}0) and age-matched healthy controls (MMSE ≥28, CDR=0). Our primary objective was to establish the diagnostic efficacy of the scans in differentiating between patients with probable disease and age-matched healthy controls on the basis of neocortical tracer uptake pattern 90-110 min post-injection. PET images were assessed visually by three readers masked to the clinical diagnosis and all other clinical findings, and quantitatively by use of pre-established brain volumes of interest to obtain standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs), taking the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00750282. Findings: 81 participants with probable Alzheimer's disease and 69 healthy controls were assessed. Independent visual assessment of the PET scans showed a sensitivity of 80{\%} (95{\%} CI 71-89) and a specificity of 91{\%} (84-98) for discriminating participants with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. The SUVRs in all neocortical grey-matter regions in participants with Alzheimer's disease were significantly higher (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) compared with the healthy controls, with the posterior cingulate being the best discriminator. Linear discriminant analysis of regional SUVRs yielded a sensitivity of 85{\%} and a specificity of 91{\%}. Regional SUVRs also correlated well with scores of cognitive impairment such as the MMSE and the word-list memory and word-list recall scores (r -0{\textperiodcentered}27 to -0{\textperiodcentered}33, p≤0{\textperiodcentered}021). APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 was more common in participants with positive PET images compared with those with negative scans (65{\%} vs 22{\%} [p=0{\textperiodcentered}027] in patients with Alzheimer's disease; 50{\%} vs 16{\%} [p=0{\textperiodcentered}074] in healthy controls). No safety concerns were noted. Interpretation: We provide verification of the efficacy, safety, and biological relevance of florbetaben ( 18F) amyloid-$\beta$ PET and suggest its potential as a visual adjunct in the diagnostic algorithm of dementia.

abstract = {We evaluated 197 patients with predominantly late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) who belonged to several ethnic groups and analyzed the relationship of age of onset of AD to the presence or absence of several risk factors in this entire group of patients. The apolipoprotein E (apoE) $\epsilon$4 allele frequency, which was 29{\%} in all patients (compared with the reported population mean of 13.7{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001, did not vary significantly between ethnic groups but declined significantly with increasing age. The apoE $\epsilon$2 allele frequency was 3{\%}, compared with the reported population mean of 7.4{\%} (p = 0.001). The frequency of a positive family history of dementia in first- degree relatives (FH+) (overall 45{\%}) did not vary significantly between ethnic groups. ApoE $\epsilon$4-positive ($\epsilon$4+) patients tended to have a higher FH+ rate (58{\%}) than apoE $\epsilon$4-negative ($\epsilon$4-) patients (40{\%}) (p = 0.02). When the potential risk factors of gender, education, FH+ status, and $\epsilon$4+ status were examined together in a multiple linear-regression analysis, FH+ and $\epsilon$4+ status (but not gender or education) were significant (they were both associated with an earlier age of onset of AD). In a post-hoc analysis, we found a reduced age of onset in women, but not men, who were both FH+ and $\epsilon$4+. Additionally, those probands who were $\epsilon$4+ were more likely to inherit the disease from their mothers than their fathers. The mechanism by which $\epsilon$4+ and FH+ status operate as risk factors may be by their effect on the age of onset of AD.},

abstract = {Measurement of correlations between brain regions (functional connectivity) using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the functional organization of the brain. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity has emerged as a major topic in the resting-state BOLD fMRI literature. Here, using simulations and multiple sets of empirical observations, we confirm that imposed task states can alter the correlation structure of BOLD activity. However, we find that observations of "dynamic" BOLD correlations during the resting state are largely explained by sampling variability. Beyond sampling variability, the largest part of observed "dynamics" during rest is attributable to head motion. An additional component of dynamic variability during rest is attributable to fluctuating sleep state. Thus, aside from the preceding explanatory factors, a single correlation structure - as opposed to a sequence of distinct correlation structures - may adequately describe the resting state as measured by BOLD fMRI. These results suggest that resting-state BOLD correlations do not primarily reflect moment-to-moment changes in cognitive content. Rather, resting-state BOLD correlations may predominantly reflect processes concerned with the maintenance of the long-term stability of the brain's functional organization.},

Noninvasive detection of tau protein deposits in the brain would be useful to diagnose tauopathies as well as to track and predict disease progression. Recently, several tau PET tracers including T807, THK-5117, and PBB3 have been developed and succeeded in imaging neurofibrillary pathology in vivo. For use of tau PET as a biomarker of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, PET tracers should have high affinity to PHF-tau and high selectivity for tau over amyloid-$\beta$ and other protein deposits. PET tau imaging enables the longitudinal assessment of the spatial pattern of tau deposition and its relation to amyloid-$\beta$ pathology and neurodegeneration. This technology could also be applied to the pharmacological assessment of anti-tau therapy, thereby allowing preventive interventions.},

abstract = {The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Previous studies of A$\beta$ plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline A$\beta$ 1-40 and A$\beta$ 1-42 plasma measurement (50{\%} with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and A$\beta$ 1-42 measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between A$\beta$ and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma A$\beta$. The effect of age differed according to AD stage. Plasma A$\beta$ 1-42 showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of A$\beta$ pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. Longitudinal measurements of A$\beta$ 1-40 and A$\beta$ 1-42 plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of A$\beta$ pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma A$\beta$) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma A$\beta$ measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma A$\beta$ measurements could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma A$\beta$ as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma A$\beta$. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Measurement of correlations between brain regions (functional connectivity) using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the functional organization of the brain. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity has emerged as a major topic in the resting-state BOLD fMRI literature. Here, using simulations and multiple sets of empirical observations, we confirm that imposed task states can alter the correlation structure of BOLD activity. However, we find that observations of "dynamic" BOLD correlations during the resting state are largely explained by sampling variability. Beyond sampling variability, the largest part of observed "dynamics" during rest is attributable to head motion. An additional component of dynamic variability during rest is attributable to fluctuating sleep state. Thus, aside from the preceding explanatory factors, a single correlation structure - as opposed to a sequence of distinct correlation structures - may adequately describe the resting state as measured by BOLD fMRI. These results suggest that resting-state BOLD correlations do not primarily reflect moment-to-moment changes in cognitive content. Rather, resting-state BOLD correlations may predominantly reflect processes concerned with the maintenance of the long-term stability of the brain's functional organization.},

abstract = {It is difficult to find the optimal sparse solution of a manifold learning based dimensionality reduction algorithm. The lasso or the elastic net penalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a lasso penalized least square problem and thus the least angle regression (LARS) (Efron et al., Ann Stat 32(2):407-499, 2004), one of the most popular algorithms in sparse learning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect ways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In this paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality reduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a series of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso penalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal sparse solution ofMEN. In particular,MEN has the following advantages for subsequent classification: (1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved for low dimensional data representation, (2) both the margin maximization and the classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection calculation, (3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in computation, (4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and (5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular datasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction algorithms. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Purpose: Radioligand binding studies indicate a down-regulation of myocardial $\beta$1-adrenoceptors ($\beta$1-AR) in cardiac disease which may or may not be associated with a decrease in $\beta$2-ARs. We have chosen ICI 89,406, a $\beta$1-selective AR antagonist, as the lead structure to develop new $\beta$1-AR radioligands for PET and have synthesised a fluoro-ethoxy derivative (F-ICI). Methods: (S)-N-[2-[3-(2-Cyano-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-propylamino]-ethyl]-N'-[4-(2-[ 18F]fluoro-ethoxy)-phenyl]-urea ((S)-[18F]F-ICI) was synthesised. Myocardial uptake of radioactivity after intravenous injection of (S)-[18F]F-ICI into adult CD1 mice or Wistar rats was assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) and postmortem dissection. Metabolism was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma and urine. Results: The heart was visualised with PET after injection of (S)-[18F]F-ICI but neither unlabelled F-ICI nor propranolol (non-selective $\beta$-AR antagonist) injected 15 min after (S)-[18F]F-ICI affected myocardial radioactivity. Ex vivo dissection demonstrated that predosing with propranolol or CGP 20712 ($\beta$1-selective AR-antagonist) did not affect myocardial radioactivity. Radiometabolites rapidly appeared in plasma and both (S)-[18F]F-ICI and radiometabolites accumulated in urine. Conclusions: Myocardial uptake of (S)-[18F]F-ICI after intravenous injection was mainly at sites unrelated to $\beta$1-ARs. (S)-[18F]F-ICI is not a suitable $\beta$1-selective-AR radioligand for PET. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases affect over 20 million people worldwide, and this number is projected to significantly increase in the coming decades. Proposed imaging-based markers have shown steadily improving levels of sensitivity/specificity in classifying individual subjects as AD or normal. Several of these efforts have utilized statistical machine learning techniques, using brain images as input, as means of deriving such AD-related markers. A common characteristic of this line of research is a focus on either (1) using a single imaging modality for classification, or (2) incorporating several modalities, but reporting separate results for each. One strategy to improve on the success of these methods is to leverage all available imaging modalities together in a single automated learning framework. The rationale is that some subjects may show signs of pathology in one modality but not in another-by combining all available images a clearer view of the progression of disease pathology will emerge. Our method is based on the Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) framework, which allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of views of the data in a maximum margin, kernel learning framework. The principal innovation behind MKL is that it learns an optimal combination of kernel (similarity) matrices while simultaneously training a classifier. In classification experiments MKL outperformed an SVM trained on all available features by 3{\%}-4{\%}. We are especially interested in whether such markers are capable of identifying early signs of the disease. To address this question, we have examined whether our multi-modal disease marker (MMDM) can predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Our experiments reveal that this measure shows significant group differences between MCI subjects who progressed to AD, and those who remained stable for 3. years. These differences were most significant in MMDMs based on imaging data. We also discuss the relationship between our MMDM and an individual's conversion from MCI to AD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Daily injection of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol is associated with the development of catalepsy sensitization in rats, which leads to a day to day increase of rigor and akinesia. The process of catalepsy sensitization incorporates different learning stages. Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization. In particular, we asked whether NMDA- and non-NMDA (AMPA- and Kainate) receptors play a role in the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization. Accordingly, rats received post-training injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (single injection of either 0.1mg/kg or 0.25mg/kg; or a double injection of 0.1mg/kg immediately and 30min after test cessation) or of the AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (single injection of 5mg/kg). Our results showed that the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization was decelerated by both glutamatergic AMPA/Kainate- and NMDA-receptor antagonists. With the higher MK-801 dosage, the deceleration was stronger, suggesting a dose dependent mechanism. We hence affirmed a role for the ionotropic glutamate receptors in the consolidation process of catalepsy sensitization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are desirable for improved diagnosis and monitoring, as well as drug discovery. Automated image-based classification of individual patients could provide valuable diagnostic support for clinicians, when considered alongside cognitive assessment scores. We investigate the value of combining cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-region FDG-PET information for classification, using clinical and imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Whole-brain segmentations into 83 anatomically defined regions were automatically generated for baseline and 12-month FDG-PET images. Regional signal intensities were extracted at each timepoint, as well as changes in signal intensity over the follow-up period. Features were provided to a support vector machine classifier. By combining 12-month signal intensities and changes over 12. months, we achieve significantly increased classification performance compared with using any of the three feature sets independently. Based on this combined feature set, we report classification accuracies of 88{\%} between patients with Alzheimer's disease and elderly healthy controls, and 65{\%} between patients with stable mild cognitive impairment and those who subsequently progressed to Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that information extracted from serial FDG-PET through regional analysis can be used to achieve state-of-the-art classification of diagnostic groups in a realistic multi-centre setting. This finding may be usefully applied in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, predicting disease course in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and in the selection of participants for clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Study protocols in endocrinological research and the neurosciences often employ repeated measurements over time to record changes in physiological or endocrinological variables. While it is desirable to acquire repeated measurements for finding individual and group differences with regard to response time and duration, the amount of data gathered often represents a problem for the statistical analysis. When trying to detect possible associations between repeated measures and other variables, the area under the curve (AUC) is routinely used to incorporate multiple time points. However, formulas for computation of the AUC are not standardized across laboratories, and existing differences are usually not presented when discussing results, thus causing possible variability, or incompatibility of findings between research groups. In this paper, two formulas for calculation of the area under the curve are presented, which are derived from the trapezoid formula. These formulas are termed 'Area under the curve with respect to increase' (AUCI) and 'Area under the curve with respect to ground' (AUCG). The different information that can be derived from repeated measurements with these two formulas is exemplified using artificial and real data from recent studies of the authors. It is shown that depending on which formula is used, different associations with other variables may emerge. Consequently, it is recommended to employ both formulas when analyzing data sets with repeated measures. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neuroimage measures from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, such as cortical thickness, have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies show that, AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) can be distinguished with relatively high accuracy using the baseline cortical thickness. With the increasing availability of large longitudinal datasets, it also becomes possible to study the longitudinal changes of cortical thickness and their correlation with the development of pathology in AD. In this study, the longitudinal cortical thickness changes of 152 subjects from 4 clinical groups (AD, NC, Progressive-MCI and Stable-MCI) selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are measured by our recently developed 4 D (spatial+temporal) thickness measuring algorithm. It is found that the 4 clinical groups demonstrate very similar spatial distribution of grey matter (GM) loss on cortex. To fully utilize the longitudinal information and better discriminate the subjects from 4 groups, especially between Stable-MCI and Progressive-MCI, 3 different categories of features are extracted for each subject, i.e., (1) static cortical thickness measures computed from the baseline and endline, (2) cortex thinning dynamics, such as the thinning speed (mm/year) and the thinning ratio (endline/baseline), and (3) network features computed from the brain network constructed based on the correlation between the longitudinal thickness changes of different regions of interest (ROIs). By combining the complementary information provided by features from the 3 categories, 2 classifiers are trained to diagnose AD and to predict the conversion to AD in MCI subjects, respectively. In the leave-one-out cross-validation, the proposed method can distinguish AD patients from NC at an accuracy of 96.1{\%}, and can detect 81.7{\%} (AUC = 0.875) of the MCI converters 6 months ahead of their conversions to AD. Also, by analyzing the brain network built via longitudinal cortical thickness changes, a significant decrease (p {\textless} 0.02) of the network clustering coefficient (associated with the development of AD pathology) is found in the Progressive-MCI group, which indicates the degenerated wiring efficiency of the brain network due to AD. More interestingly, the decreasing of network clustering coefficient of the olfactory cortex region was also found in the AD patients, which suggests olfactory dysfunction. Although the smell identification test is not performed in ADNI, this finding is consistent with other AD-related olfactory studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We developed a landscape-scale suitability model for interior northern California to predict the probability of detecting fishers and to identify areas of important fisher habitat. Previous models have been extrapolated to this region, but our model was developed from the results of strategically planned detection surveys within the study area. We used generalized additive modeling to create a model that best distinguished detection (n= 55) from non-detection (n= 90) locations on the basis of environmental covariates. Four models were averaged to create a final model including the following variables: Amount of Dense Forest, Percent Hardwood, Medium {\&} Large Trees, Structurally Complex Forest, Adjusted Elevation, Insolation Index and Predicted Abundance of Mammalian Prey. This model was well calibrated and correctly classified fisher detections 83.6{\%} of the time and absences (non-detections) 70.0{\%}. Independent test data were classified less well; 76.2{\%} and 53.0{\%}, respectively, perhaps a result of differences in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data used to build versus test the model. The model is the first comprehensive portrayal of the distribution and configuration of habitat suitability in this region and provides managers a tool to monitor habitat change over time and to plan vegetation treatments. It also represents an example for the development of similar models for dispersal-limited mammals with large area needs, as well as other species associated with late-successional forests in northern California. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is acquiring FDG PET, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, and other biomarker measurements in a large longitudinal multi-center study of initially mildly affected probable AD (pAD) patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, who are at increased AD risk, and cognitively normal controls (NC), and we are responsible for analyzing the PET images using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Here we compare baseline CMRgl measurements from 74 pAD patients and 142 aMCI patients to those from 82 NC, we correlate CMRgl with categorical and continuous measures of clinical disease severity, and we compare apolipoprotein E (APOE) e{\{}open{\}}4 carriers to non-carriers in each of these subject groups. In comparison with NC, the pAD and aMCI groups each had significantly lower CMRgl bilaterally in posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietotemporal and frontal cortex. Similar reductions were observed when categories of disease severity or lower Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were correlated with lower CMRgl. However, when analyses were restricted to the pAD patients, lower MMSE scores were significantly correlated with lower left frontal and temporal CMRgl. These findings from a large, multi-site study support previous single-site findings, supports the characteristic pattern of baseline CMRgl reductions in AD and aMCI patients, as well as preferential anterior CMRgl reductions after the onset of AD dementia. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Accurate segmentation of brain tumour in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a difficult task due to various tumour types. Using information and features from multimodal MRI including structural MRI and isotropic (p) and anisotropic (q) components derived from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may result in a more accurate analysis of brain images. Methods: We propose a novel 3D supervoxel based learning method for segmentation of tumour in multimodal MRI brain images (conventional MRI and DTI). Supervoxels are generated using the information across the multimodal MRI dataset. For each supervoxel, a variety of features including histograms of texton descriptor, calculated using a set of Gabor filters with different sizes and orientations, and first order intensity statistical features are extracted. Those features are fed into a random forests (RF) classifier to classify each supervoxel into tumour core, oedema or healthy brain tissue. Results: The method is evaluated on two datasets: 1) Our clinical dataset: 11 multimodal images of patients and 2) BRATS 2013 clinical dataset: 30 multimodal images. For our clinical dataset, the average detection sensitivity of tumour (including tumour core and oedema) using multimodal MRI is 86{\%} with balanced error rate (BER) 7{\%}; while the Dice score for automatic tumour segmentation against ground truth is 0.84. The corresponding results of the BRATS 2013 dataset are 96{\%}, 2{\%} and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: The method demonstrates promising results in the segmentation of brain tumour. Adding features from multimodal MRI images can largely increase the segmentation accuracy. The method provides a close match to expert delineation across all tumour grades, leading to a faster and more reproducible method of brain tumour detection and delineation to aid patient management.},

abstract = {Amylin is a metabolic peptide hormone that is co-secreted with insulin from beta cells in the pancreas and activates many of the downstream targets of insulin. To investigate the relationship between this hormone and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured plasma human amylin levels in 206 subjects with AD, 64 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 111 subjects with no cognitive impairment and found significantly lower amylin levels among subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment compared with the cognitively intact subjects. To investigate mechanisms underlying amylin's effects in the brain, we administered chronic infusions of the amylin analog pramlintide in the senescence-accelerated prone mouse, a mouse model of sporadic AD. Pramlintide administration improved performance in the novel object recognition task, a validated test of memory and cognition. The pramlintide-treated mice had increased expression of the synaptic marker synapsin I and the kinase cyclin-dependent kinase-5 in the hippocampus, as well as decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the hippocampus. A dose-dependent increase in cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and activation of extracellular-signal-regulated-kinases 1/2 by pramlintide treatment invitro was also present indicating functionality of the amylin receptor in neurons. Together these results suggest that amylin analogs have neuroprotective properties and might be of therapeutic benefit in AD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {An empirical modeling of road related and non-road related landslide hazard for a large geographical area using logistic regression in tandem with signal detection theory is presented. This modeling was developed using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data, and was implemented on the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho. The approach is based on explicit and quantitative environmental correlations between observed landslide occurrences, climate, parent material, and environmental attributes while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used as a measure of performance of a predictive rule. The modeling results suggest that development of two independent models for road related and non-road related landslide hazard was necessary because spatial prediction and predictor variables were different for these models. The probabilistic models of landslide potential may be used as a decision support tool in forest planning involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.

abstract = {Background and Aims: FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in self-tolerance and suppress the effective antitumor immune response. A recent study revealed that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated tryptophan depletion was able to affect local tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the tumor-infiltrating Tregs and tumoral IDO expression during the progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas. Methods: We investigated the prevalence and localization of FOXP3+ Tregs, CD8+ lymphocytes, and IDO expression in IPMNs by immunohistochemistry. We recruited 39 cases with IPMNs (IPMA: adenoma, n = 11; IPMB: borderline malignancy, n = 9; IPMC: noninvasive carcinoma, n = 7; I-IPMC: invasive IPMC, n = 12). Results: The prevalence of Tregs increased step by step during the carcinogenesis of IPMNs (Kruskal-Wallis test: p {\textless} 0.0001). IDO expression in the tumor was observed in 5 cases with IPMNs (IPMC, n = 1; I-IPMC, n = 4). IDO expression in the tumor was positively correlated with the prevalence of Tregs in IPMNs. Conclusions: FOXP3+ Tregs play a role in controlling the immune surveillance against IPMNs at the premalignant stage. IDO expression in the tumor is one of the late-stage phenomena of multistage carcinogenesis of IPMNs. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel and IAP.},

abstract = {The globalization of financial markets has broadened investment opportunities. International investors' investmentportfolios consist of financial instruments from various countries; consequently, the risks associated with economic dependence among countries should be carefully considered. Step-down equity-linked securities (ELS) are a structured financial product that have recently become popular among Korean investors. Payoffs are based on two or three stock indices from different regions; therefore, dependence between the indices should be reflected in the risk analysis. In this study, we consider a regime-switching copula model to describe the joint behavior of two stock indices- the Eurostoxx50 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI). These indices are commonly used as underlying assets of step-down ELS. Using historical data, we analyze the risk associated with step-down ELS through the probabilities of early redemption. A regime-switching copula model can accommodate complicated dependence. Thus, it should be considered in the risk analysis of step-down ELS.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of separation or monotone likelihood is observed in the fitting process of a logistic model if the likelihood converges while at least one parameter estimate diverges to ± infinity. Separation primarily occurs in small samples with several unbalanced and highly predictive risk factors. A procedure by Firth originally developed to reduce the bias of maximum likelihood estimates is shown to provide an ideal solution to separation. It produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Corresponding Wald tests and confidence intervals are available but it is shown that penalized likelihood ratio tests and profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals are often preferable. The clear advantage of the procedure over previous options of analysis is impressively demonstrated by the statistical analysis of two cancer studies.

abstract = {Automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) processing pipelines and different multivariate techniques are gaining popularity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. We used four supervised learning methods to classify AD patients and controls (CTL) and to prospectively predict the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD from baseline MRI data. A total of 345 participants from the AddNeuroMed cohort were included in this study; 116 AD patients, 119 MCI patients and 110 CTL individuals. High resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets were acquired and MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer. We explored the classification ability of orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS), decision trees (Trees), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Applying 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated that SVM and OPLS were slightly superior to Trees and ANN, although not statistically significant for distinguishing between AD and CTL. The classification experiments resulted in up to 83{\%} sensitivity and 87{\%} specificity for the best techniques. For the prediction of conversion of MCI patients at baseline to AD at 1-year follow-up, we obtained an accuracy of up to 86{\%}. The value of the multivariate models derived from the classification of AD vs. CTL was shown to be robust and efficient in the identification of MCI converters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Worms such as CodeRed and Slammer can compromise hundreds of thousands of hosts within hours or even minutes, and cause millions of dollars of damage 26, 43. To successfully combat these fast automatic Internet attacks, we need fast automatic attack detection and filtering mechanisms. In this paper we propose dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection of overwrite attacks, which include most types of exploits. This approach does not need source code or special compilation for the monitored program, and hence works on commodity software. To demonstrate this idea, we have implemented TaintCheck, a mechanism that can perform dynamic taint analysis by performing binary rewriting at run time. We show that TaintCheck reliably detects most types of exploits. We found that TaintCheck produced no false positives for any of the many different programs that we tested. Further, we describe how TaintCheck could improve automatic signature generation in several ways.},
